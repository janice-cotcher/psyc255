The cranial-distal arrow runs vertically behind the torso and lower abdomen. The cranial arrow is pointing toward the head while the caudal arrow is pointing toward the tail bone. The posterior/anterior arrow is running horizontally through the back and chest. The posterior or dorsal arrow is pointing toward the back while the anterior, or ventral arrow, is pointing toward the abdomen. On the anterior view, the proximal/distal arrow is on the right arm. The proximal arrow is pointing up toward the shoulder while the distal arrow is pointing down toward the hand. The lateral-medial arrow is a horizontal arrow on the abdomen. The medial arrow is pointing toward the navel while the lateral arrow is pointing away from the body to the right. Right refers to the right side of the woman’s body from her perspective while left refers to the left side of the woman’s body from her perspective."&gt;

The cranial cavity is a large, bean-shaped cavity filling most of the upper skull where the brain is located. The vertebral cavity is a very narrow, thread-like cavity running from the cranial cavity down the entire length of the spinal cord. Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity. The thoracic cavity consists of three cavities that fill the interior area of the chest. The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone. The superior mediastinum is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities. The pericardial cavity within the mediastinum is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart. The diaphragm divides the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity. Together the abdominal and pelvic cavity can be referred to as the abdominopelvic cavity while the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities together can be referred to as the ventral body cavity."&gt;

            alt='This is a two column-table containing both text and illustrations. The left column is titled germ layer while the right column is titled “Gives rise to.” The germ layer in the first row is ectoderm. Ectoderm gives rise to epidermis, glands on the skin, some cranial bones, the pituitary and adrenal medulla, the nervous system, the tissue between the cheeks and gums, and the anus. This row contains three pictures. The leftmost picture illustrates several layers of yellow, oval-shaped skin cells with purple nuclei. The middle diagram shows a neuron, which is a yellow, star shaped cell with finger like branches at its corners. The neuron also has a purple nucleus and a yellow tube that connects to the bottom of the cell. The right image in this row shows a brown pigment cell embedded at the bottom layer of several skin cells. It is secreting dark-colored pigment into the skin cells from tentacle-like projections. The germ layer in the second row is mesoderm. Mesoderm gives rise to connective tissues, bone, cartilage, blood, the endothelium of blood vessels, muscle, synovial membranes, serous membranes that line body cavities, the kidneys, and the lining of the gonads. Five images are given in this row to illustrate. The leftmost image is cardiac muscle, which is cylindrical and curved. There are many open spaces between neighboring cardiac muscles. The next image shows skeletal muscle, which is a series of closely stacked cylinders with well defined horizontal striping. The middle image shows three tubule cells of the kidney, which are square shaped and contain a brown nucleus. The fourth image shows a series of red blood cells, which are red and saucer shaped with a slight depression at the center. The fifth image shows smooth muscles which are tightly packed, diamond shaped cells with oval-shaped nuclei. Endoderm gives rise to the lining of the airways and digestive system (except the mouth and distal part of digestive system). Also, the rectum and anal canal, digestive glands, endocrine glands, and adrenal cortex all develop from endoderm. The leftmost image in this row shows a lung cell, which is a large, purple, trapezoid-shaped cell. The middle image shows a pair of thyroid cells, which are rectangle-shaped with the upper edge of each cell having a row of finger like projections, similar in appearance to carpet. The rightmost image in this row shows a pancreatic cell, which is large and wedge-shaped. The pancreatic cell has small indentations throughout its cell membrane." width="520" id="6"&gt;'

        <p>G. Glandular
          Epithelia:</p>
        <p>1. ___________ glands or __________ are diffused through the
          bloodstream
          to their target cells. Examples:</p>
        <p>2. __________ glands release their content outside of the body such
          as
          breast milk, sweat and mucous.</p>
        <p>a. These glands can be unicellular or multicellular. ________ cells
          are
          examples of unicellular cells.</p>
        <p>b. ________ glands can either excrete their content via a __________
          duct
          or ___________.</p>
        <p><img
            alt='This table shows the different types of exocrine glands: alveolar (acinar) versus tubular and those with simple ducts versus compound ducts. Each diagram shows a single layer of columnar epithelial cells with a line of cells travelling along the surface of a tissue (surface epithelium) and then dipping into a hole in the tissue. The cells travel down the right side of the hole until they reach the bottom, then curve around the bottom of the hole and then travel up the left side. Finally, the cells emerge back onto the surface of the tissue. The surface epithelial cells are those that are on the surface of the tissue; the duct cells are those that line both walls of the hole. The gland cells are those that line the bottom of the hole. The shape of the hole differs in each gland. In the simple alvelolar (acinar) gland, the duct and gland cells are bulb shaped with the gland cells being the larger end of the bulb. Simple alveolar glands are not found in adults, as these represent an early developmental stage of simple, branched glands. In simple tubular glands, the duct and gland cells are U shaped. Simple tubular glands are found in the intestinal glands. In simple branched alveolar glands, the gland cells form three bulbs at the end of the duct, similar in appearance to a clover leaf. The sebaceous (oil) glands are examples of simple branched alveolar glands. In simple coiled tubular glands, the duct and gland cells form a U, however, the bottom of the U, which is all gland cells, is curved up to the right. Merocrine sweat glands are examples of simple coiled tubular glands. In simple branched tubular glands, the duct is very short and the gland cells divide into three lobes, similar in appearance to a bird’s foot. The gastric glands of the stomach and mucous glands of the esophagus, tongue and duodenum are examples of simple branched tubular glands. Among the glands with compound ducts, compound alveolar (acinar) glands have three sets of clover leaf bulbs, for a total of six bulbs. Two of the clover leaf shaped structures extend parallel to the surface epithelium in opposite directions to each other. The third clover leaf extends down into the tissue, perpendicular to the surface. The duct is cross-shaped. The mammary glands are an example of compound alveolar glands. Compound tubular glands have a similar structure to compound alveolar glands. However, instead of three cloverleaf shaped bulbs, the compound tubular gland has three bird’s foot shaped bulbs. The duct is also cross-shaped in the compound tubular gland. The mucous glands of the mouth and the bulbourethral glands of the male reproductive system are examples of compound tubular glands, which are also found in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Compound tubuloalveolar glands are a hybrid between the compound alveolar gland and the compound tubular gland. The two sets of bulbs that run parallel to the surface are bird-foot shaped; however, the set of bulbs that runs perpendicularly below the surface is cloverleaf shaped. The salivary glands, glands of the respiratory passages and glands of the pancreas are all compound tubuloalveolar glands." width="550" id="13"&gt;'

        <p>c. Modes of glandular secretion:</p>

        <p><img
            alt='These three diagrams show the three modes of secretion. All three diagrams show three orange cells in a line with attached to a basement membrane. Each cell has a large nucleus in its lower half. The upper half of each cell contains a Golgi apparatus, which appears like an upside down jellyfish. Yellow secretory vesicles are budding from the top end of the Golgi apparatus. Each vesicle contains several orange circles, which are the secreted substance. In merocrine secretion, the secretory vesicles travel to the top edge of the cells and release the secretion from the cell by melding with the cell membrane. In apocrine secretion, the top third of the cell, which contains the secretory vesicles, pinches in at the sides and then completely disconnects above the Golgi complex. The pinched off portion of the cell is the secretion, as it contains the majority of the secretory vesicles. In holocrine secretion, the upper third of the cell, just above the Golgi complex, forms many finger like projections. Each projection contains several vesicles. The tips of the projections that contain secretory vesicles bud off from the cell. In this method of secretion, the mature cell eventually dies and becomes the secretory product." width="400" id="15"&gt;'

The wound extends through the upper layer of skin, labeled the epidermis, about halfway through the dermis, the lower deeper layer of skin. At the base of the cross section, an artery runs horizontally through fatty tissue below the dermis. Several small capillaries branch from the artery and travel into the upper regions of the dermis. In the first step of healing, inflammatory chemicals, symbolized with green dots, are released from the injury site. The chemicals travel through the dermis and enter the horizontal artery. Clotting proteins and plasma proteins also initiate clotting within the wound, forming a scab, which is clearly visible in the second step as a black and brown mass covering the upper regions of the wound. Below the scab, epithelial cells in the epidermis multiply and begin to fill in the wound. In the dermis, three fibrocytes are binding the wound area with white tissue. This tissue is granulation tissue. Laying down granulation tissue restores the vascular supply, as indicated by capillaries growing around the wounded area. In the third step, the scab is gone and the epidermis has grown in and contracted to seal the upper portion of the wound. In the deeper regions, the wound is now completely filled with granulation tissue with is now considered scar tissue."

          Functional Anatomy of Skin</p>
        <p>A. Most accessible but often least appreciated organ system.</p>
        <p>1.
          The skin, or simply integument, accounts for
          approximately 16% of your total body weight.</p>
        <p>2.
          The skin’s surface, 1.5 - 2.0 m<sup>2</sup>, is
          constantly worn away, attacked by micro-organisms, irradiated by
          sunlight, and
          exposed to environmental chemicals.</p>
        <p>3.
          Skin is composed of two major components:</p>
        <p>a. Cutaneous membrane:</p>
        <p>
          i.
          The <b>epidermis</b> consists of stratified
          squamous.</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          The <b>dermis</b> consists of a papillary layer of
          areolar tissue and a reticular layer of dense irregular connective
          tissue.</p>
        <p>b. Accessory Structures:</p>
        <p>
          i.
          Nerve fibers and corpuscles</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          Hair follicles, hair shafts, and arrector pili
          muscles</p>
        <p>
          iii.
          Oil glands and sweat glands</p>
        <p>
          iv.
          Arteries, veins, and lymph vessels forming the <b>cutaneous
            network</b></p>
        <p>4.
          The <b>hypodermis</b> (also known as the
          subcutaneous layer or superficial fascia) separates the integument
          from the
          fascia around the deeper organs. Note this layer is NOT part of the
          integument.</p>

        <p>5.1 The
          Layers of the Skin </p>
        <p>1.
          The <b>EPIDERMIS</b> is composed of layers with
          various functions.</p>
        <p>A. The epidermis is dominated by <b><u>keratinocytes</u></b>, the
          body’s
          most abundant epithelial cells. These cells form several layers called
          <b>strata</b>.</p>
        <p>1.
          Thin skin, which covers most of the body surface,
          contains four strata and is about as thick as the wall of a plastic
          sandwich
          bag (roughly 0.08 mm).</p>
        <p>2.
          Thick skin, which occurs on the palms of the hands
          and soles of the feet, possesses five strata. It is about as thick as
          a
          standard paper towel (roughly 0.50 mm). </p>
        <p>3.
          Note that the terms “thick” and “thin” refer to the
          relative thickness of the epidermis, not the integument as a
          whole.</p>
        <p>B. Strata of the Epidermis</p>
        <p>1.
          Stratum Basale</p>
        <p>a. The deepest epidermal layer consisting of a single row of <b>basal
            cells</b>, or germinative cells, that are undergoing rapid mitotic
          divisions.
          These cells are sometimes called stem cells because their mitotic
          divisions
          replace the more superficial keratinocytes that are lost or shed at
          the
          surface.</p>
        <p>b. Hemidesmosomes attach the cells of this layer to the basal lamina
          that
          separates the epidermis from the areolar tissue of the adjacent
          papillary layer
          of the dermis. </p>
        <p>c. Approximately 10 – 25% of cells in this layer are melanocytes
          which
          produce <b>melanin</b>, a brown, yellowish-brown, or black skin
          pigment.</p>
        <p>d. In hairless skin, specialized cells called <b>merkel cells</b>
          exist in
          small numbers. These cells are sensitive to touch and when compressed,
          they
          release chemicals that stimulate sensory nerve endings.</p>
        <p>2.
          Stratum Spinosum</p>
        <p>a. Consists of approximately 8 – 10 layers of keratinocytes bound
          together
          by desmosomes and microfilaments of pre-keratin. </p>
        <p>b. The name <i>stratum spinosum</i>, which means “spiny layer”,
          refers to
          the fact that the cells look like miniature pincushions in standard
          histological sections.</p>
        <p>c. Large numbers of <b>dendritic cells</b> are found in this layer.
          These
          are specialized cells that participate in the immune response by
          stimulating a
          defense mechanism against 1) microorganisms that manage to penetrate
          the
          superficial layers of the epidermis and 2) superficial skin
          cancers.</p>
        <p>3.
          Stratum Granulosum</p>
        <p>a. Consists of 3 – 5 cell layers where the keratinocytes appearance
          begins
          to change. The name <i>stratum granulosum</i> means “grainy
          layer”.</p>
        <p>b. These cells become flattened, the plasma membrane becomes less
          permeable, and the organelles deteriorate.</p>
        <p>c. By the time the cells reach this layer, most have stopped dividing
          and
          have started making large amounts of <b>keratin</b> and
          <b>keratinohyalin </b>stored
          in numerous visible granules.</p>
        <p>d. Beyond this layer, there is no nutrient availability.</p>
        <p>4.
          Stratum Lucidum</p>
        <p>a. In the thick skin of the palms and soles, a stratum lucidum
          separates
          the stratum corneum from deeper layers. </p>
        <p>b. The cells of this layer are flattened, densely packed, largely
          devoid
          of organelles, and filled with the proteins keratin and
          keratohyalin.</p>
        <p>c. By the time they reach the stratum lucidum, the cells are dead and
          undergoing dehydration.</p>
        <p>5.
          Stratum Corneum</p>
        <p>a. Outermost layer of keratinocytes (sometimes called the “horny
          layer”).</p>
        <p>b. A broad zone of 15 – 30 layers of keratinized cells that accounts
          for
          up to three-quarters of the epidermal thickness.</p>
        <p>c. Keratinization is the formation of protective, superficial layers
          of
          cells filled with keratin.</p>
        <p>d. The dead cells in each layer of the stratum corneum remain tightly
          interconnected by desmosomes. It takes 7 to 10 days for a cell to move
          from
          the stratum basale to the stratum corneum. The dead cells generally
          remain in
          the exposed stratum corneum for an additional two weeks before they
          are shed or
          washed away. </p>
        <p>e. Glycolipids in this layer provide a waterproofing quality to the
          epidermis.</p>
        <p>C. The deeper layers of the epidermis form <b><u>epidermal
              ridges</u></b>
          which extend into the dermis and are adjacent to the dermal
          projections called <b>dermal
            papillae </b>that project upward to the epidermis. These ridges and
          papillae
          are significant because they greatly increase the surface area for
          attachment,
          firmly binding the epidermis to the dermis.</p>
        <p>D. The ridge patterns in the thick skin on the surface of the
          fingertips
          produce fingerprints, which have been used to identify individuals in
          criminal
          investigations for more than a century.</p>
        <p>E. Like all other epithelia, the epidermis lacks local blood vessels.
          Epidermal cells rely of the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from
          capillaries
          within the dermis. As a result the cells with the highest metabolic
          demand are
          closest to the underlying dermis</p>

        <p>Name the types of tissues
          associated with the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis.</p>

        <p>List the 5 major layers of
          epidermis and describe the functions and characteristics of each.</p>

        <p>2.
          The <b>DERMIS</b> supports the epidermis, and the
          hypodermis connects the dermis to the rest of the body.</p>
        <p>A. The <b>dermis</b> lies between the epidermis and hypodermis. The
          dermis consists of two layers:</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Papillary layer</u></b> = consists of a highly
          vascularized areolar tissue with all of the typical cell types within
          it. </p>
        <p>a. This layer also contains the capillaries, lymphatic vessels, and
          sensory neurons that supply the surface of the skin. </p>
        <p>b. The papillary layer gets its name from the dermal papillae that
          project
          between the epidermal ridges.</p>
        <p>c. This layer nourishes and supports epidermis.</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Reticular layer</u></b> = consists of an
          interwoven meshwork of dense irregular connective tissue containing
          both
          collagen and elastic fibers. </p>
        <p>a. Bundles of collagen fibers extend superficially to blend into
          those of
          the papillary layer and deeply to blend with the hypodermis. </p>
        <p>b. The collagen fibers provide strength while the elastic fibers
          provide
          flexibility.</p>
        <p>c. This layer restricts the spread of pathogens, stores lipid
          reserves,
          attaches skin to deeper tissues, possesses sensory receptors, and
          contains
          blood vessels for temperature regulation.</p>
        <p>B. <b><u>Cleavage Lines</u></b> = within the dermis, the
          collagen and elastin fibers are arranged in parallel bundles oriented
          to resist
          the forces applied to the skin during normal movements. The resulting
          pattern
          of fiber bundles establishes the lines of cleavage. These lines are
          clinically
          significant: a cut parallel to a cleavage line will usually remain
          closed and
          heal with little scarring whereas a cut at a right angle to a cleavage
          line
          will be pulled open as movement occurs and result in greater
          scarring.</p>

        <p>List the 2 major areas of the
          dermis and describe the characteristics of each.</p>

        <p>3.
          The <b>hypodermis</b> separates the skin from
          deeper structures. </p>
        <p>1. It stabilizes the position of skin in relation to underlying
          tissues
          (such as skeletal muscles or other organs) while permitting
          independent
          movement. </p>
        <p>2. Because it is often dominated by adipose tissue, the hypodermis
          also
          represents an important site for 1) insulation, 2) cushioning, and 3)
          the
          storage of energy reserves. </p>
        <p>3. At puberty men accumulate subcutaneous fat at the neck, on the
          arms,
          along the lower back, and over the buttock. In contrast, women
          accumulate
          subcutaneous fat at the breasts, buttocks, hips, and thighs. In both
          genders,
          there are almost no fat cells on the back of the hands and feet but
          distressingly large numbers in the abdominal regions (resulting in the
          “potbelly”).</p>
        <p>4.
          Factors influencing <b>skin color </b>include
          epidermal pigmentation and dermal circulation.</p>
        <p>A. The color of one’s skin is genetically programmed. However,
          increased
          pigmentation, or tanning, can result in response to ultraviolet
          radiation.</p>
        <p>B. Skin color is influenced by the presence of pigments in the
          epidermis:</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Melanin</u></b> = a brown, yellowish-brown, or
          black pigment produced by melanocytes.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Melanocytes</u></b> are located within the stratum
          basale, squeezed between or deep to the keratinocytes. Melanocytes
          manufacture
          melanin from the amino acid <b>tyrosine</b>, and package it in
          intracellular
          vesicles called <b><u>melanosomes</u></b>.</p>
        <p>b. Melanosomes travel within the processes of melanocytes and are
          transferred intact to keratinocytes. The transfer of pigmentation
          colors the
          keratinocyte temporarily, until the melanosomes are destroyed by
          fusion with
          lysosomes. </p>
        <p>c. In individuals with pale skin, this transfer occurs in the stratum
          basale and stratum spinosum, and the cells of more superficial layers
          lose
          their pigmentation. In dark-skinned individuals, the melanosomes are
          larger,
          and the transfer may occur in the stratum granulosum as well; thus
          skin
          pigmentation is darker and more persistent.</p>
        <p>d. The skin covering most areas of the body has about 1000
          melanocytes per
          square millimeter. Differences in skin pigmentation among individuals
          do not
          reflect different numbers of melanocytes but instead different levels
          of
          melanin production.</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Carotene</u></b> = an orange-yellow pigment that
          normally accumulates in epidermal cells. It is most apparent in cells
          of the
          stratum corneum of light-skinned individuals, but it also accumulates
          in fatty
          tissues in the deep dermis and hypodermis. Carotene is found in a
          variety of
          orange and yellow vegetables (sweet potatoes, carrots, squash).</p>
        <p>C. The
          blood supply affects skin color because blood contains red blood cells
          filled
          with the red pigment <b>hemoglobin</b>. </p>
        <p>1. When bound to oxygen, hemoglobin is bright red, giving capillaries
          in
          the dermis a reddish tint that is most apparent in light-skinned
          individuals. </p>
        <p>2. If those vessels are dilated, the red tones become much more
          pronounced. For example, your skin becomes <b><u>flushed</u></b> and
          red when
          your body temperature rises because the superficial blood vessels
          dilate so
          that the skin can act like a radiator and lose heat.</p>
        <p>3. When the blood flow decreases, oxygen levels in the tissues
          decline,
          and under these conditions hemoglobin releases oxygen and turns a much
          darker
          red. Seen from the surface the skin takes on a bluish color. This
          coloration
          is called <b><u>cyanosis</u></b>. In individuals of any skin color,
          cyanosis
          is most obvious in areas of very thin skin (lips and under the
          fingernails).</p>

        <p>Describe the factors that
          normally contribute to skin color.</p>

        <p>5.2 Accessory
          Organs of the Skin</p>
        <p>A. Hair and its associated structures:</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Hair follicles</u></b> are a complex structure
          composed of epithelial cells and connective tissues that are
          responsible for
          the formation of a single hair. The hair follicle has three regions
          (the
          internal root sheath, the external root sheath, and glassy
          membrane).</p>
        <p>2. Hair production begins at the base of the hair follicle. Here a
          mass
          of epithelial cells forms a cap, called the <b><u>hair bulb</u></b>
          that
          surrounds a smaller <b><u>hair papilla</u></b>, a peg of connective
          tissue
          containing capillaries and nerves.</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Root hair plexus</u></b> are sensory nerves that
          surround the hair bulb and give hair the ability to detect touch.</p>
        <p>4. Associated with each hair follicle is a bundle of smooth muscle
          cells
          called an <b><u>arrector pili muscle</u></b>. These muscles will
          contract and
          cause hairs to stand up or become erect.</p>
        <p>5. The human body has about 2.5 million hairs and 75% of them are on
          the
          general body surface and not on the head. Hairs are non-living
          structures
          composed of keratinocytes. </p>
        <p>6. Parts of a Hair:</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Hair shaft</u></b> is the portion of the hair that
          extends through the follicle and protrudes above the skin line.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Hair root</u></b> the portion that anchors the
          hair into the skin</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Cuticle</u></b> forms the surface of the hair.
          Composed of <b>hard keratin</b>.</p>
        <p>d. <b><u>Cortex</u></b> an intermediate layer of cells deep
          to the cuticle. Contains thick layers of <b>hard keratin</b>, which
          give hairs
          their stiffness.</p>
        <p>e. <b><u>Medulla</u></b>, or core, consists of cells at the
          center of the hair matrix filled with <b>soft keratin</b>.</p>
        <p>f.
          <b><u>Hair matrix</u></b>
          consists of superficial cells of the hair bulb. These germinative
          cells in the
          hair matrix produce the hair.</p>
        <p>7. Variations in hair color reflect differences in hair structure and
          variation in the pigment produced by melanocytes at the hair papilla.
          Different forms of melanin give a dark brown, yellow-brown, or red
          color to the
          hair. As pigment production decreases with age, hair color lightens.
          White
          hair results from the combination of a lack of pigment and the
          presence of air
          bubbles in the medulla of the hair shaft.</p>
        <p>B. <b><u>Nails</u></b> = thick sheets of keratinized
          epidermal cells.</p>
        <p>1. <b>Nails</b> protect the exposed dorsal surfaces of
          the tips of the fingers and toes. They also help limit distortion of
          the
          digits whey they are subjected to mechanical stress.</p>
        <p>2. The cells producing the nails can be affected by conditions that
          alter
          body metabolism, so changes in the shape, structure, or appearance of
          the nails
          can provide useful diagnostic information.</p>
        <p>3. Parts of a nail:</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Nail body</u></b> = consists of dead, tightly
          compressed keratinocytes packed with keratin. The nail body is the
          portion of
          the nail to which polish might be applied.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Nail bed</u></b> = the nail body covers an area of
          the epidermis that contains rapidly dividing cells that divide to
          replace the
          cells that are lost.</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Nail root</u></b> = the epidermal fold not visible
          from the surface and anchors the nail body into the underlying
          tissues; the
          deepest portion of the nail root lies very close to the bone of the
          fingertip.</p>
        <p>d. <b><u>Hyponychium</u></b> = the free edge of the nail
          composed of a thickened stratum corneum; the distal portion that
          continues past
          the nail bed.</p>
        <p>e. <b><u>Eponychium</u></b> = a portion of stratum corneum
          of the nail root that extends over the exposed nail; more commonly
          called the
          cuticle.</p>
        <p>f.
          <b><u>Lunula</u></b> = a pale
          crescent shaped area near the root where the dermal blood vessels are
          obscured;
          may not be present in all nails</p>

        <p>Describe the structure and
          function of nails.</p>

        <p>C. Glands</p>
        <p>1. Sebaceous glands = oil glands</p>
        <p>a. Simple alveolar glands that are found all over the body except on
          the
          palms and the soles. Sebaceous follicles secrete onto skin surfaces
          located on
          the face, back, chest, nipples, and external genitalia.</p>
        <p>b. Contractions of the arrector pili muscles squeeze the sebaceous
          gland
          and force the <b><u>sebum</u></b> (a mixture of triglycerides,
          cholesterol,
          proteins, and electrolytes) into the hair follicle and onto the
          surface of the
          skin.</p>
        <p>c. These glands are the <b><u>holocrine type</u></b>, the cells fill
          up
          with oil then bust.</p>
        <p>d. Sebum is secreted into a <b><u>hair follicle</u></b>, or
          occasionally a
          pore, or follicle, on the skin surface.</p>
        <p>e. Sebum softens and lubricates hair and surrounding skin and also
          has
          anti-bacterial properties.</p>
        <p>2. Sweat glands</p>
        <p>a. Distributed all over the surface of the body except the nipple,
          parts
          of the external genitalia, and the lips.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Eccrine (merocrine) sweat glands</u></b> are very
          numerous in the palms, soles of the feet and forehead.</p>
        <p>
          i.
          Eccrine gland secretions, commonly called <b><u>sweat</u></b>,
          are a hypotonic filtrate of the blood that passes through secretory
          cells of
          the sweat gland and is release by exocytosis.</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          Once released, the sweat travels via a duct to the
          surface of the skin where it opens into a funnel-shaped pore.</p>
        <p>
          iii.
          Normal pH of sweat is between 4 and 6.</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Apocrine sweat glands</u></b>* are largely
          confined to the axillary and anogenital areas.</p>
        <p>
          i.
          Larger than eccrine sweat glands and release their
          secretions into hair follicles.</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          The secretions produced are similar to sweat but
          they also contain fatty substances and proteins.</p>
        <p>
          iii.
          Apocrine glands begin functioning at puberty.</p>
        <p>d. Ceruminous glands</p>
        <p>
          i.
          Modified Apocrine glands that line the external ear
          canal and secrete a sticky, bitter substance called cerumen.</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          <b><u>Cerumen</u></b>=earwax.</p>
        <p>e. Mammary glands</p>
        <p>
          i.
          Specialized Apocrine sweat gland that secretes <b><u>milk</u></b>.
        </p>

        <p>Compare and contrast the
          modified sweat glands including: eccrine, apocrine, ceruminous, and
          mammary
          glands.</p>

        <p>Compare the structure, location,
          and product of sweat glands versus oil glands.</p>

        <p>5.3 Functions
          of the integumentary system</p>
        <p>A. Protection</p>
        <p>B. Sensory: The integument contains many sensory receptors:</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Free nerve endings</u></b> = numerous
          unencapsulated nerve endings for pain and temperature detection</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Tactile discs</u></b> = extend from the dermis
          into the epidermis where they connect to Merkel cells and monitor the
          chemical
          secretions from these cells which produce tactile stimuli.</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Tactile corpuscles (Meissner’s corpuscles)</u></b>
          = receptors located in the dermal papillae; responsible for the
          detection of
          light touch</p>
        <p>4. <b><u>Lamellated corpuscles (Pacinian corpuscles)</u></b> =
          receptors located in the reticular layer of the dermis; responsible
          for detection of deep pressure and vibration</p>
        <p>C. Thermoregulation: your skin can help regulate your body
          temperature via
          vasodilation and vasoconstriction.</p>
        <p>D. Vitamin D synthesis:<b><u> Hormonal Vitamin D</u></b> = also known
          as
          calcitriol. When exposed to ultraviolet light, epidermal cells in the
          stratum
          spinosum and stratum basale converts a cholesterol-related steroid
          into <b>cholecalciferol</b>.
          Although cholecalciferol can be obtained from the diet, few foods
          contain it.
          In fact most foods that contain cholecalciferol have been fortified
          with it.
          The liver then converts cholecalciferol into an intermediary product
          used by
          the kidneys to synthesize the hormone <b><u>calcitriol</u></b>.
          Calcitriol is
          required for stimulating normal absorption of calcium and phosphorus
          in the
          small intestine. An inadequate supply of calcitriol leads to impaired
          bone
          growth and maintenance such as typical of <b><u>rickets</u></b>.</p>

        <p>5.4 Diseases,
          disorders and injuries of the immune system</p>
        <p>A. <b>Skin cancers</b> are the most common types of
          cancer.</p>
        <p>1. The most common form of skin cancer is <b><u>basal cell
              carcinoma</u></b>.
          This is a cancer that originates in keratinocytes of the stratum
          basale, due to
          mutations caused by overexposure to the UV light. Metastasis virtually
          never
          occurs in basal cell carcinomas, and most people survive these
          cancers.</p>
        <p>2. In contrast, <b><u>melanoma</u></b> is the least common form of
          skin
          cancer but is extremely dangerous. In this condition cancerous
          melanocytes
          within the stratum basale grow rapidly and metastasize through the
          lymphatic
          system. The outlook for long-term survival is in many cases determined
          by how
          early the condition is diagnosed. If the cancer is detected early,
          while it is
          still localized, the affected area can be surgically removed, and the
          5-year
          survival rate is 99 percent. If the condition is not detected until
          extensive
          metastasis has occurred, the 5-year survival rate drops to 14%.</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Squamous cell carcinoma</u></b> originates in the
          stratum spinosum layer and like basal cell carcinoma, it rarely
          metastasizes.</p>
        <p>B. <b>Eczema</b> is an allergic reaction that manifests
          as dry, itchy patches of skin that look like a rash. It may swell,
          flake, crack
          and bleed and can be treated with corticosteroids and
          immunosuppressants. </p>
        <p>C. <b>Acne </b>occurs from an overproductive, blocked
          sebaceous gland. </p>
        <p>D. <b>Injuries and Burns: First degree burn</b> effects
          only the epidermis. <b>Second degree burn</b> goes deeper and effects
          both
          epidermis and dermis. <b>Third degree burn</b> extends through the
          epidermis
          and dermis to damage underlying tissue and nerve endings. <b>Fourth
            degree burn</b>
          includes damage to all of the above as well as muscle and bone. Full
          thickness
          burns can NOT be repaired by the body and require a skin graft. </p>
        <p>E. <b>Scars</b> are collagen-rich skin formed after the
          process of wound healing that differs from normal skin. <b>Keloids</b>
          are
          raised scars</p>
        <p>F. <b>Bedsores</b> happen in areas exposed to prolong
          pressure resulting in loss of blood flow and necrosis of the tissues.
        </p>
        <p>G. <b>Stretch Marks</b> result from the skin is
          stretched beyond its normal capacity. </p>
        <p>H. <b>Calluses</b> and <b>Corns</b> form from areas of
          constant abrasion. </p>

        <p>5.5 Age-related
          changes alter the appearance of structure of the integument.</p>
        <p>A. Melanocyte activity declines, and in light skinned individuals,
          the
          skin becomes pale. With less melanin in the skin, people become more
          sensitive
          to sun exposure and more likely to experience sunburn.</p>
        <p>B. Sebaceous gland secretions decreases with age and the skin becomes
          dry
          and often scaly.</p>
        <p>C. The epidermis thins as germinative cell activity declines, and the
          connections between the epidermis and dermis weakens, making older
          people more
          prone to injury, skin tears, and skin infections. </p>
        <p>D. The metabolic activity in the skin decreases as well. Synthesis of
          calcitriol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) decreases leading to muscle
          weakness and
          brittle bones.</p>
        <p>E. The number of dendritic cells decreases to about half the levels
          seen
          at maturity. This reduction in cells may decrease sensitivity of the
          immune
          response and further encourage skin damage and infection.</p>
        <p>F. The dermis becomes thinner and has fewer elastic fibers, making
          the
          integument weaker and less resilient. The results – sagging and
          wrinkling –
          are most pronounced in body regions with the most sun exposure.</p>
        <p>G. Merocrine sweat glands become less active and with impaired
          perspiration processes, older people cannot lose hear at fast as
          younger
          people. Thus the elder are at greater risk of overheating in warm
          environments.</p>
        <p>H. A reduction in dermal blood supply cools the skin, which can
          stimulate
          thermoreceptors and make a person feel cold even in a warm room.
          Reduced
          circulation and sweat gland function lessens their ability to lose
          body heat,
          which can cause their body temperature to soar dangerously high.</p>
        <p>I.
          With declining levels of sex hormones, differences
          in secondary sexual characteristics with respect to hair distribution
          and
          body-fat distribution begin to fade. As a consequence, people age 90 –
          100 of
          both sexes tend to look alike.</p>
        <p>J. Hair follicles stop functioning or produce thinner, finer hairs.
          With
          decreased melanocyte activity, these hairs are gray or white.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 6 </h1>
        <p>6.1 The
          Functions of the Skeletal System</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Support</u></b> = provides structural support for
          the entire body. Individual bones or groups of bones provide a
          framework for
          the attachment of soft tissues and or organs.</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Protection</u></b> = delicate tissues and organs
          are often surrounded by skeletal elements. The ribs protect the heart
          and
          lungs, the skull encloses the brain, the vertebrae shield the spinal
          cord, and
          the pelvis cradles delicate urinary and reproductive organs.</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Leverage</u></b> = many bones of the skeleton
          function as levers that can change the magnitude and direction of the
          forces
          generated by skeletal muscles. The movements produced range from the
          delicate
          motions of a fingertip to powerful changes in the position of the
          entire body.</p>
        <p>4. <b><u>Storage of minerals</u></b> = the calcium salts of
          bone represents a valuable mineral reserve that maintains normal
          concentrations
          of calcium and phosphate ions in the body fluids. Calcium is the most
          abundant
          mineral in the human body. A typical human body contains 1-2 kg of
          calcium,
          with more than 98 % of it deposited in the bones of the skeleton.</p>
        <p>5. <b><u>Blood cell production</u></b> = also known as
          hematopoiesis; red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are
          produced
          in the red bone marrow, which fills the internal cavities of many
          bones.</p>

        <p>6.2 Bone Classification:</p>
        <p>A. The adult skeleton system
          includes approximately 206 separate bones and a number of associated
          cartilages. This body system is divided into the axial skeleton and
          appendicular skeleton.</p>
        <p>1.
          <b><u>Axial skeleton</u></b> =
          (80 bones) consists of the bones of the skull, hyoid, sternum, rib
          cage,
          vertebral column, sacrum, and coccyx.</p>
        <p>2.
          <b><u>Appendicular skeleton</u></b> = (126 bones) includes bones of
          the limbs and the pectoral and pelvic
          girdles that attach the limbs to the axial skeleton.</p>
        <p>B. Bones are classified according to shape and structure and also
          their
          surface features.</p>
        <p>1.
          <b><u>Flat bones </u></b>=
          thin, roughly parallel surfaces. Flat bones form the roof of the
          skull,
          sternum, the ribs, and the scapulae. They provide protection from
          underlying
          soft tissues and offer an extensive surface for the attachment of
          skeletal
          muscles.</p>
        <p>2.
          <b><u>Sutural bones</u></b> =
          also known as Wormian bones; are small, flat, irregularly shaped bones
          between
          the flat bones of the skull. There are individual variations in the
          number,
          shape, and position of sutural bones. Their borders are like pieces of
          a
          jigsaw puzzle, and they range in size from a grain of sand to a
          quarter.</p>
        <p>3.
          <b><u>Long bones</u></b> = are
          relatively long and slender. They are located in the arm, forearm,
          thigh,
          lower leg, palms, soles, fingers and toes. The femur, the long bone of
          the
          thigh, is the largest and heaviest bone in the body.</p>
        <p>4.
          <b><u>Irregular bones</u></b>
          = have complex shapes with short, flat, notched, or ridged surfaces.
          The
          spinal vertebrae, the bones of the pelvis, and several of the skull
          bones
          (mandible for example) are irregular bones.</p>
        <p>5.
          <b><u>Sesamoid bones</u></b> =
          are generally small, flat, and shaped somewhat like a sesame seed.
          They
          develop inside of tendons and are most commonly located near joints at
          the
          knees, the hands, and the feet. Everyone has sesamoid patellae, or
          kneecaps,
          but individuals vary in the location and abundance of other sesamoid
          bones.
          This variation, among others, accounts for disparities in the total
          number of
          bones in the skeleton.</p>
        <p>6.
          <b><u>Short bones</u></b> =
          small and boxy. Examples of short bones include bones of the wrist
          (carpals)
          and bones of the ankles (tarsals).</p>

        <p>6.3 Bone Structure</p>
        <p>A. Gross Anatomy of long bones: Long bones are designed to transmit
          forces
          along the shaft and have a rich blood supply.</p>
        <p>1.
          <b><u>Diaphysis</u></b> = long
          tubular shaft that forms the axis of a typical long bone; the walls of
          the
          shaft are made primarily of <b>compact bone</b>.</p>
        <p>2.
          <b><u>Epiphyses</u></b> = ends
          of the bones composed primarily of <b>spongy bone</b>, also called
          <b>trabecular
            bone</b>. Spongy bone consists of an open network of struts and
          plates (called
          trabeculae) that resemble a latticework with red bone marrow filling
          in the
          spaces between. The spongy bone is then covered by a thin layer of
          compact
          bone and articular cartilage.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Proximal epiphyses</u></b>=end closest to the
          origin of attachment.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Distal epiphyses</u></b>=end furthers from the
          origin of attachment.</p>
        <p>3.
          <b><u>Metaphysis</u></b> = a
          narrow zone that connects the diaphysis to the epiphyses. The
          <b>epiphyseal
            plate</b>, a thin layer of hyaline cartilage more commonly called
          the growth
          plate, is important for growth in the length of bones.</p>
        <p>4.
          <b><u>Medullary cavity</u></b>
          = within the shaft of a long bone is a cavity where bone marrow is
          located. In
          childhood, the medullary cavity is filled with <b>red bone marrow</b>
          but as we
          age, fat accumulates within the red marrow transforming it to
          <b>yellow bone
            marrow</b>. Red bone marrow is important for hematopoiesis but
          yellow bone
          marrow is no longer hematopoietic and instead stores fat as an
          important energy
          source.</p>
        <p>5.
          Membranes associated with bone:</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Periosteum</u></b>=outermost covering of bone made
          primarily of dense irregular tissue and held on by Sharpey’s fibers
          (collagen).</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Endosteum</u></b>=internal membrane of bone made
          of connective tissue. Also lines the many canals that pass through
          bone to
          supply blood and nerves to the bone.</p>
        <p>6.
          <b><u>Nutrient foramen</u></b>
          = in order for bones to grow and be maintained, they require an
          extensive blood
          supply. The nutrient foramen is a tunnel that penetrates the diaphysis
          and
          provides access for the blood vessels into the shaft of the bone.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Nutrient artery</u></b> = transports oxygenated,
          nutrient-rich blood to the bone.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Nutrient vein</u></b> = transports deoxygenated,
          waste-laden blood from the bone.</p>
        <p>7.
          <b><u>Metaphyseal artery and metaphyseal vein</u></b> = carry blood to
          and from the area of the metaphysis and to the
          epiphysis.</p>
        <p>8.
          <b><u>Articular cartilage</u></b> = covers portions of the epiphysis
          that articulate with other bones.
          The cartilage is avascular, <b>hyaline cartilage</b>. It relies
          primarily on
          diffusion from the synovial fluid to obtain oxygen and nutrients and
          to
          eliminate wastes.</p>

        <p>B. Bone Markings: also known as surface features</p>
        <p>1. Depressions and openings allowing blood vessels and nerves to
          pass</p>
        <p>
          i.
          <b><u>Fossa</u></b> = a
          shallow depression or recess in the surface of a bone</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          <b><u>Fissure</u></b> = a
          narrow, slit-like opening or an elongated cleft or gap</p>
        <p>
          iii.
          <b><u>Foramen</u></b> = round
          or oval opening through the bone</p>
        <p>
          iv.
          <b><u>Canal or meatus</u></b>
          = a large passageway through the a bone</p>
        <p>
          v.
          <b><u>Sulcus or groove</u></b>
          = a furrow or narrow trough in a bone</p>
        <p>
          vi.
          <b><u>Sinus</u></b> = a
          chamber within a bone filled with air and lined with a mucous
          membrane.</p>
        <p>2. Projections that are sites for muscle and ligament attachment </p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Tuberosity</u></b>= large, round or rough
          projection that may cover a broad area</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Crest</u></b>=narrow ridge of bone; usually
          prominent</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Trochanter</u></b>=very large, irregularly shaped
          projection</p>
        <p>d. <b><u>Line</u></b>=narrow ridges of bone; less prominent
          than a crest</p>
        <p>e. <b><u>Tubercle</u></b>=small, rounded projection</p>
        <p>f.
          <b><u>Epicondyle</u></b>=raised
          area above a condyle</p>
        <p>g. <b><u>Spine</u></b>=sharp, slender, and often pointed
          process</p>
        <p>3. Projections that form joints</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Head</u></b>=expanded proximal end of a bone
          carried on a narrow neck</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Facet</u></b>=smooth, flat articular surface</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Condyle</u></b>=smooth, rounded articular surface</p>
        <p>d. <b><u>Ramus</u></b>=arm-like bar of a bone</p>
        <p>C. Microscopic
          anatomy of compact bone cells and tissues.</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Osteon</u></b> = the basic structural and
          functional unit of bone consisting of bone cells organized around a
          central
          canal and separated by concentric lamellae.</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Central canal</u></b> = also known as the <b>Haversian
            canal</b>, runs parallel to the axis of bone and are located in the
          middle of
          each osteon. Each central canal possesses an artery and vein, lymph
          vessel,
          and nerve.</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Perforating canals</u></b> = passageways that
          extend perpendicular to the axis of the bone and connect the central
          canals of
          adjacent osteons.</p>
        <p>4. <b><u>Lamellae</u></b> = nested, concentric rings of
          matrix surrounding the central canal.</p>
        <p>1.
          <b><u>Circumferential lamellae</u></b> = specialized lamellae found at
          the outer and inner surfaces of bone,
          where they are covered by the periosteum and endosteum, respectively.
          These
          lamellae are produced during the growth and maintenance of bone.</p>
        <p>2.
          <b><u>Interstitial lamellae</u></b> = fill in the spaces between
          adjacent osteons of compact bone. These
          lamellae are remnants of osteons whose matrix components have been
          almost
          completely recycled by the action of bone digesting cells.</p>
        <p>5. <b><u>Lacunae</u></b> = mature bones cells, called
          osteocytes, are trapped within an open space called a lacuna.
          Osteocytes
          cannot divide and therefore each lacuna contains only one
          osteocyte.</p>
        <p>6. <b><u>Canaliculi</u></b> = processes of the osteocytes
          extend into narrow crevices, called canaliculi, that penetrate the
          lamellae and
          connect the lacunae to the central canal.</p>
        <p>D. Bone
          is associated with four cells that account for approximately 2% of the
          bones
          weight.</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Osteocytes</u></b> = mature bone cells that
          maintain the protein and mineral content of the surrounding matrix
          through the
          turnover of matrix components. Osteocytes secrete chemicals that
          dissolve the
          adjacent matrix, and the release minerals enter the circulation. The
          osteocytes
          then rebuild the matrix, stimulating the deposition of mineral
          crystals.
          Osteocytes also participate in the repair of damaged bones.</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Osteoblasts</u></b> = immature bone cells located
          on the surface of bone; produce new bone matrix in a process called
          <b>osteogenesis</b>,
          or <b>ossification</b>. Osteoblasts make and release the proteins and
          other
          organic components of the matrix. Before calcium salts are deposited,
          this
          organic matrix is called <b><u>osteoid</u></b>. Osteocytes develop
          from
          osteoblasts that have become completely surrounded by bone matrix and
          trapped
          within a lacuna.</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Osteoprogenitor cells</u></b> = mesenchymal cells
          located with the periosteum and endosteum. These stem cells divide to
          produce
          daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts, and they are
          important in
          the formation of osteocytes.</p>
        <p>4. <b><u>Osteoclasts</u></b> = bone digesting cells that
          remove and recycle bone matrix. These are giant cells with 50 or more
          nuclei.
          Osteoclasts are not related to osteoprogenitor cells or their
          descendants.
          Instead, they are derived from the same stem cells that produce
          phagocytic
          white blood cells, called monocytes. Acids and proteolytic enzymes
          secreted by
          osteoclasts dissolve the matrix and release stored minerals. This
          process,
          called <b><u>osteolysis</u></b>, or resorption, is important in bone
          remodeling.</p>
        <p>E. Chemical composition of bone:</p>
        <p>1. Organic <b><u>Osteoid</u></b> = roughly 1/3 of the weight of bone
          is
          contributed by collagen fibers. Collagen fibers are strong and
          flexible, but
          if they are compressed, they bend.</p>
        <p>2. Inorganic <b><u>Hydroxyapatites</u></b> = mineral salts account
          for
          almost 2/3 of the weight of bone. Calcium phosphate interacts with
          calcium
          hydroxide to form crystals of hydroxyapatite. As they form, these
          crystals
          incorporate other calcium salts, such as calcium carbonate, and ions
          such as
          sodium, magnesium, and fluoride. By combining the hydroxyapatite with
          the
          collagen fibers, a strong, somewhat flexible, material is produced.
          Furthermore, this protein-crystal combination is highly resistant to
          shattering. In fact, bone is far superior to concrete and is more in
          par with
          steel-reinforced concrete.</p>

        <p>6.4 Bone
          Formation and Development </p>
        <p>A. The formation of bone, osteogenesis or ossification, begins during
          embryonic development. Two types of osteogenesis occur in the
          embryo:</p>
        <p>1.
          Endochondral Ossification</p>
        <p>1.
          Formation of most bones using a hyaline cartilage
          model. Begins approximately 6 weeks after fertilization.</p>
        <p>2.
          Hyaline cartilage does not turn into bone instead
          it is broken down as ossification occurs.</p>
        <p>3.
          Steps of endochondral ossification:</p>
        <p>
          i.
          <b><u>Cavitation of hyaline shaft</u></b>: (picture #1 and #2 in the
          diagram)</p>
        <p>a. Chondrocytes within the shaft hypertrophy (enlarge) and the
          surrounding
          matrix begins to calcify.</p>
        <p>b. The impermeable matrix causes chondrocytes to die from lack of
          nutrients leaving the matrix that starts to deteriorate
          (cavitate).</p>
        <p>c. Blood vessels grow around the edges of the cartilage. </p>
        <p>d. The cells of the perichondrium convert to osteoblasts producing a
          superficial layer of bone sometimes called the bony collar.</p>
        <p>
          ii.
          <b><u>Invasion of internal cavities</u></b>: (picture #3 in the
          diagram)</p>
        <p>a. Blood vessels penetrate the cartilage and invade the central
          region.
          This area within the shaft of hyaline cartilage is called the
          <b>primary
            ossification center</b>.</p>
        <p>b. Migrating with the blood vessels are fibroblasts (which
          differentiate
          into osteoblasts), lymph vessels, nerve fibers, red marrow elements.
          Collectively, these are called the <b>periosteal bud</b>.</p>
        <p>c. The osteoblasts secrete osteoid around remaining fragments of
          hyaline,
          forming trabeculae, or spongy bone.</p>
        <p>
          iii.
          Formation of the Medullary cavity: (picture #4 in
          the diagram)</p>
        <p>a. As the primary ossification center enlarges, osteoclasts break
          down
          newly formed spongy bone and opens up a medullary cavity in the center
          of the
          diaphysis.</p>
        <p>b. The osseous tissue of the outer shaft becomes thicker forming
          compact
          bone.</p>
        <p>
          iv.
          <b><u>Formation of epiphyses</u></b>: (picture #5 in the diagram)</p>
        <p>a. <b>Secondary ossification centers</b> appear in the
          area at the opposite ends of the bone. The cartilage in the epiphyses
          calcifies and deteriorates, forming cavities that allow entry of a
          periosteal
          bud.</p>
        <p>b. Soon the epiphyses are filled with spongy bone. The spongy bone is
          NOT
          broken down during the remodeling process.</p>

        <p>2.
          Intramembranous Ossification</p>
        <p>a. Formation of bones without a cartilage model. Typical in flat
          bones,
          mandible, clavicles, and patella. Begins approximately 8 weeks after
          fertilization.</p>
        <p>b. Mesenchyme cells differentiate into osteoblasts within fibrous
          connective tissues. This type of ossification normally occurs in the
          deeper
          layers of the dermis or in the connective tissues of tendons.</p>
        <p>c. Steps of intramembranous ossification:</p>
        <p>a. Formation of bone matrix within fibrous membrane:</p>
        <p>a. Mesenchymal cells cluster and secrete organic components of the
          matrix. The location of this activity is the <b>ossification
            center</b>.</p>
        <p>b. The resulting osteoid mineralizes and the mesenchymal cells
          differentiate into osteoblasts.</p>
        <p>c. As ossification proceeds, the osteoblasts get trapped within
          lacunae
          and differentiate into osteocytes.</p>
        <p>b. Formation of woven bone and periosteum:</p>
        <p>a. Osteoid accumulates, fuses together forming struts called
          <b>trabeculae</b>,
          or spicules, around blood vessels.</p>
        <p>b. The overall structure is similar to spongy bone.</p>
        <p>c. Formation of compact bone plate:</p>
        <p>a. Initially, the intramembranous bone consists of spongy bone only.
        </p>
        <p>b. Subsequent remodeling around trapped blood vessels can produce
          osteons
          typical of compact bone.</p>
        <p>c. As the rate of growth slows at the surface, the connective tissue
          around the bone becomes organized into the fibrous layer of the
          periosteum.</p>
        <p>B. The growth of bone occurs by two primary processes:</p>
        <p>A. Longitudinal Growth (length)</p>
        <p>a. Hyaline cartilage cells form tall columns at the <b>epiphyseal
            plate</b>
          (or growth plate) and within the articular cartilage.</p>
        <p>b. The cells at the top of the stack divide quickly, increasing the
          thickness of the epiphyseal plates and causing the entire long bone to
          lengthen.</p>
        <p>c. Older chondrocytes closer to the shaft enlarge, die, and the
          surrounding cartilage matrix deteriorates.</p>
        <p>d. The deterioration leaves spicules of calcified cartilage.</p>
        <p>e. Osteoblasts in the medullary cavity then ossify the cartilage
          spicules,
          forming spongy bone.</p>
        <p>f.
          The hyaline cartilage at the epiphyseal plate is
          eventually replaced entirely by bone. Once completely replaced with
          bone, the
          epiphyseal plate is now called the <b>epiphyseal line</b>. This
          typically
          occurs in the person’s early twenties and as a result the person stops
          growing
          in height. </p>
        <p>B. Appositional Growth (width)</p>
        <p>a. Osteoprogenitor cells beneath the periosteum differentiate into
          osteoblasts and form new osteons on the external bone surface.</p>
        <p>b. While bone is being added to the outer surface through
          appositional
          growth, osteoclasts are removing and recycling lamellae at the inner
          surface.
          As a result, the medullary cavity gradually enlarges as the bone
          increases in
          diameter.</p>
        <p>c. Appositional growth is important in increasing the diameter of
          existing
          bones but it does not form the original bone. </p>

        <p>6.5 Fractures:
          Repair of cracked or broken bones:</p>
        <p>A. Hematoma formation</p>
        <p>1. Blood vessels in bone tear and hemorrhage occurs.</p>
        <p>2. Over a period of several hours, a large blood clot, or
          <b>hematoma</b>,
          develops.</p>
        <p>B. Fibrocartilage callus formation</p>
        <p>1. Capillaries grow into the hematoma and phagocytic cells invade the
          area.</p>
        <p>2. Fibroblasts and osteoblasts migrate to the fracture.</p>
        <p>3. Fibroblasts secrete collagen fibers and/or differentiate into
          chondroblasts that secrete a cartilage matrix.</p>
        <p>4. Osteoblasts form spongy bone.</p>
        <p>5. The mass of repair tissue is referred to as a <b><u>fibrocartilage
              callus</u></b>.</p>
        <p>6. An <b>internal callus</b> connects bone ends and an <b>external
            callus</b>
          protrudes from the outer bone surface.</p>
        <p>C. Bony callus formation</p>
        <p>1. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts continue to migrate inward and
          multiply
          rapidly in the fibrocartilaginous callus.</p>
        <p>2. As the material calcifies, the tissue becomes a <b><u>bony
              callus</u></b>.</p>
        <p>D. Fractures are classified on the basis of:</p>
        <p>1. Whether the bone penetrates the skin.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Simple</u></b> (closed) =bone breaks cleanly, but
          does not penetrate the skin.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Compound</u></b> (open) =broken ends of bone
          protrude through the tissue and skin.</p>
        <p>2. Orientation of the break.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Transverse</u></b>=break occurs perpendicular to
          the long axis of a bone.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Linear</u></b>=breaks parallel to the long axis of
          the bone.</p>
        <p>3. Position of the bone ends after the fracture.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Non-displaced</u></b>=the bone ends retain their
          position.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Displaced</u></b>=the bone end are out of normal
          alignment.</p>
        <p>E. Types of Fractures</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Comminuted</u></b> = bone
          fragments into many pieces.</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Compression</u></b> = bone is
          crushed from upward and downward forces</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Depressed</u></b> = broken
          bone is pressed inward (skull)</p>
        <p>4. <b><u>Spiral</u></b> = raged break
          as a result of excessive twisting of the bone.</p>
        <p>5. <b><u>Epiphyseal</u></b> = break
          occurring along the epiphyseal plate</p>
        <p>6. <b><u>Greenstick</u></b> = bone
          breaks incompletely</p>
        <p>7. <b><u>Colle’s</u></b> = distal part
          of the radius breaks</p>
        <p>8. <b><u>Pott’s</u></b> = malleolus of
          tibia and fibula break</p>
        <p>6.6 Exercise, Nutrition and Hormones and
          Bone Tissue</p>
        <p>A. Exercise – lack of exercise and
          stress on bone can lead to loss of bone mass.</p>
        <p>B. Nutrition </p>
        <p>1. <b>Calcium and Vitamin D:</b>
          Since the body cannot make calcium, it must be obtained from the diet.
          However,
          calcium cannot be absorbed from the small intestine without vitamin D.
          Therefore, intake of vitamin D is also critical to bone health. Dairy
          as well
          as leafy vegetables are a source of calcium. </p>
        <p>2. <b>Vitamin K</b> also supports bone
          mineralization and may have a synergistic role with vitamin D in the
          regulation
          of bone growth. Green leafy vegetables are a good source of vitamin K.
        </p>
        <p>C. Hormones: </p>
        <p>1. <b>Growth Hormone</b>: synthesized
          in the pituitary controls bone growth in multiple ways. It It triggers
          chondrocyte proliferation in epiphyseal plates, resulting in the
          increasing
          length of long bones. GH also increases calcium retention, which
          enhances
          mineralization, and stimulates osteoblastic activity, which improves
          bone
          density. </p>
        <p>2. <b>Thyroxine</b>: secreted by the
          thyroid gland promotes osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone
          matrix. </p>
        <p>3. Sex Hormones: <b>Estrogen</b> and
          <b>Testosterone</b> promote osteoblastic activity and production of
          bone
          matrix, and in addition, are responsible for the growth spurt that
          often occurs
          during adolescence. They also promote the conversion of the epiphyseal
          plate to
          the epiphyseal line (i.e., cartilage to its bony remnant), thus
          bringing an end
          to the longitudinal growth of bones. </p>
        <p>4. <b>Calcitriol</b> = the active form
          of vitamin D, is produced by the kidneys and stimulates the absorption
          of
          calcium and phosphate from the digestive tract. </p>

        <p>6.7 Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of
          the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems </p>
        <p>A. Bone is constantly undergoing deposition and resorption in a
          process
          known as <b>remodeling</b>.</p>
        <p>B. Coordinated activity by osteoblasts and osteoclasts regulates both
          processes.</p>
        <p>1. Bone deposition occurs where bone is injured or added bone
          strength is
          needed and is accomplished by osteoblasts. Bands of new matrix
          deposited in
          the area are referred to as an osteoid seam. </p>
        <p>2. Bone reabsorption is accomplished by osteoclasts. Osteoclasts
          secrete
          lysosomal enzymes that digest the organic matrix and then secrete
          metabolic
          acids that convert calcium salts into soluble forms.</p>
        <p>C. Remodeling is under negative feedback hormonal control.</p>
        <p>1. Changes in the levels of blood calcium will trigger the release of
          either parathyroid hormone (PTH) or calcitonin. </p>
        <p>2. When blood calcium levels are too low: the <b>parathyroid
            gland</b>
          secretes <b><u>parathyroid hormone</u></b>, or PTH. PTH has three
          effects all
          leading to a drop in blood calcium levels:</p>
        <p>a. Bone response = stimulates osteoclasts so they accelerate the
          erosion
          of bone matrix which leads to the release of stored calcium ions into
          the
          blood.</p>
        <p>b. Intestinal response = PTH enhances the calcium-absorbing effects
          of
          calcitriol on the intestine. As a result the rate of intestinal
          calcium
          absorption increases.</p>
        <p>c. Kidney response = PTH increases the production of the hormone
          calcitriol, which is continuously secreted by the kidneys at low
          levels. This
          hormone in turn stimulates calcium reabsorption at the kidney
          tubules.</p>
        <p>3. When blood calcium levels are too high: the <b>C cells of the</b>
          <b>thyroid
            gland</b> secrete <b><u>calcitonin</u></b>. Calcitonin has three
          effects all
          leading to a drop in blood calcium levels:</p>
        <p>a. Bone response = calcitonin inhibits osteoclasts but does not
          affect
          osteoblasts so that they continue to deposit calcium ions into the
          matrix of
          bone.</p>
        <p>b. Intestinal response = calcitonin decreases the rate of calcium
          absorption from foods in the digestive tract.</p>
        <p>c. Kidney response = calcitonin inhibits the absorption of calcium in
          urine so that more calcium is excreted from the body.</p>
        <p>D. By providing a calcium reserve, the skeleton plays the primary
          role in
          the homeostatic maintenance of normal calcium ion concentration of
          body
          fluids. The skeleton is also important in the homeostatic balance of
          other
          ions as well.</p>

        <p>6.8 Bone
          Disorders</p>
        <p>A. <b><u>Pituitary growth failure</u></b> = or dwarfism,
          results from inadequate production of growth hormone which leads to
          reduced
          epiphyseal cartilage activity and abnormally short bones. Rare in the
          United
          States because children can be treated with synthetic growth
          hormone.</p>
        <p>B. <b><u>Achondroplasia</u></b> = results from abnormal
          hyaline cartilage development. Because hyaline cartilage forms the
          model for
          long bone formation, the individual will have short, stocky limbs but
          the torso
          and head are of normal size.</p>
        <p>C. <b><u>Marfan syndrome</u></b> = very tall with long,
          slender limbs due to excessive cartilage formation at the epiphyseal
          plates.
          Other defects in the structure of connective tissues commonly cause
          life-threatening cardiovascular problems.</p>
        <p>D. <b><u>Gigantism</u></b> = results from an overproduction
          of growth hormone before puberty. Puberty is often delayed. The most
          common
          cause is a pituitary tumor which may be treated by surgery, radiation,
          or drugs
          that suppress the release of growth hormone.</p>
        <p>E. <b><u>Acromegaly</u></b> = result from too much growth
          hormone after the epiphyseal plates close so that the bones do not
          grow longer
          but instead get thicker (especially the bones of the face, hands, and
          jaw).
          This leads to changes in their physical appearance. </p>
        <p>F. <b><u>Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</u></b>
          (FOP) = a rare gene mutation that causes the deposition of bone around
          skeletal
          muscles and the normally soft tissues of the body. There is no
          effective
          treatment for this painful and debilitating condition, and patients
          seldom
          survive into their 40’s.</p>
        <p>G. <b><u>Paget’s Disease</u></b> = overactive osteoclasts
          cause pores and weakening of the long bones leading to bending/bowing.
          Osteoblasts try to compensate for the overactive osteoclasts, but the
          bone laid
          down is weak and brittle and prone to fractures. </p>

        <p><b>11.1
          </b>Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their
          Fascicle Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems </p>
        <p>A. The skeletal muscles of the muscular system account for almost
          half of
          the weight of our bodies.</p>
        <p>1. The human body contains approximately 700 skeletal muscles that
          differ
          widely in size, shape, and function.</p>
        <p>2. Although the individual skeletal muscle fibers contract the same
          way
          and to the same degree, the performance of a skeletal muscle varies
          depending
          on the way the muscle fibers are organized and how the muscles attach
          to the
          skeleton.</p>
        <p>B. All muscles have at least two points of attachment:</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Origin</u></b> = the fixed attachment point</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Insertion</u></b> = the moveable attachment point</p>
        <p>c. The origin is typically proximal to the insertion when the body is
          in
          anatomical position.</p>
        <p>C. When
          complex movements occur, muscles commonly work in groups rather than
          individually. Their cooperation improves the efficiency of a
          particular
          movement. For example, large muscles of the limbs produce flexion or
          extension
          over an extended range of motion.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Agonist</u></b>=a muscle that provides the major
          force for producing a specific movement. Also known as the “prime
          mover”.
        </p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Antagonist</u></b>=muscles that oppose, or
          reverse, a particular movement.</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Synergists</u></b>=muscles that help prime movers
          by: Adding a little extra force to the same movement or undesirable or
          unnecessary movements that might occur as the prime movers contract.
        </p>
        <p>d. <b><u>Fixators</u></b>=when synergists immobilize a
          bone, or a muscle’s origin.</p>
        <p>D. Fascicle
          Organization</p>
        <p>1. <b><u>Circular</u></b> = also
          called a sphincter muscle; when the fascicles are arranged in
          concentric rings
          (example: orbicularis oris)</p>
        <p>2. <b><u>Convergent</u></b>=when the muscle has a broad
          origin and the fascicles converge toward a single tendon or insertion
          (example: pectoralis major)</p>
        <p>3. <b><u>Parallel</u></b>=the long axes of the fascicles
          run parallel to the long axis of the muscle. Strap-like muscles
          (example: sartorius and biceps brachii)</p>
        <p>4. <b><u>Pennate</u></b>=the fascicles are short and they
          attach obliquely to a central tendon that runs the length of the
          muscle.</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Unipennate</u></b>=the fascicles insert into only
          one side of the tendon (example: extensor digitorum longus)</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Bipennate</u></b>=fascicles insert into the tendon
          from opposite sides so that the muscle’s “grain” resembles a feather
          (example: rectus femoris)</p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Multipennate</u></b>=arrangement looks like many
          feathers situated side by side (example: deltoid)</p>
        <p>E. Muscle Mechanics: Lever Systems</p>
        <p>1. The operation of most skeletal muscles involves the use of
          leverage and
          a lever system. </p>
        <p>2. A <b><u>lever</u></b> is a rigid bar – such as a board, a crowbar,
          or a
          bone – that moves on a fixed point, or <b><u>fulcrum</u></b>, when a
          force is
          applied to it. The applied force, or <b><u>effort</u></b>, is used to
          move a
          resistance, or <b><u>load</u></b>. </p>
        <p>3. In the human body, joints are the fulcrums, your bones act as
          levers,
          and your muscle provide the effort. </p>
        <p>4. Levers can operate in one of two ways: </p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Mechanical advantage</u></b>: the load is close
          to the fulcrum and the effort is applied far from the fulcrum. This
          situation
          requires minimal effort to move a large load and is therefore designed
          for
          power. <i>Power lever</i> </p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Mechanical disadvantage</u></b>: the load is far
          from the fulcrum and the effort is applied near the fulcrum. This
          situation
          requires the force to be greater than the load to be moved but
          although it
          cannot move a large load, it can move loads farther and faster.
          <i>Speed lever</i>
        </p>
        <p>5. Depending on the relative positions of the three elements (effort,
          fulcrum, and load), a lever belongs to one of three classes: </p>
        <p>a. <b><u>First-class lever</u></b> = the fulcrum (F) lies
          between the applied force (AF) and the load (L). An example: scissors
          or the
          capitis muscles.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Second-class lever</u></b> = the load (L) lies
          between the applied force (AF) and the fulcrum (F). An example:
          wheelbarrow or
          the gastrocnemius. </p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Third-class lever</u></b> = the most common of
          levers in the body, the applied force (AF) is located between the load
          (L) and
          the fulcrum (F). An example: tweezers and biceps brachii.</p>

        <h2>16.1 Overview of the Neurological Exam</h2>
        <p>A.
          The <b>neurological exam</b> is a
          clinical assessment tool used to rapidly determine which specific
          parts of the
          CNS are affected by damage or disease. The exam can be broken down
          into the
          following subsets:</p>
        <p>1.
          <b>Mental Status Exam</b> =
          assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory, orientation,
          and
          language.</p>
        <p>2.
          <b>Cranial Nerve Exam</b> =
          tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the
          central and
          peripheral structures associated with them.</p>
        <p>3.
          <b>The Sensory Exam</b> =
          tests the sensory functions associated with the spinal nerves.</p>
        <p>4.
          <b>The Motor Exam</b> = tests
          the motor functions associated with the spinal nerves</p>
        <p>5.
          <b>The Coordination Exam</b> =
          tests the ability to perform complex and coordinated movements. <b>The
            Gait
            Exam</b> = specifically assesses the motor function of walking and
          can be
          considered part of the coordination exam because walking is a
          coordinated
          movement.</p>
        <p>B.
          Causes of Neurological Deficits:</p>
        <p>1.
          <b><u>Stroke</u></b> also
          called <b>CVA</b> cerebrovascular accident= the loss of blood flow to
          a part of
          the brain</p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Ischemic stroke</u></b> = the loss of blood flow
          to an area because vessels are blocked or narrowed. This is often
          caused by an
          embolus (blood clot or fat deposit), thickening of the vessel wall or
          drop in
          blood volume = <b>hypovolemia</b>. <b>Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
          </b>is
          similar to an ischemic stroke, but symptoms are resolved within 24
          hours. </p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Hemorrhagic</u></b><u> <b>stroke</b></u> = bleeding into the
          brain because of a damaged blood vessel.
          Accumulated blood fills in a region of the cranial vault and presses
          against
          the tissue in the brain. This pooling blood causes secondary symptoms
          such as
          loss of function, pressure on neighboring arteries resulting in a
          larger damage
          area, potentially compromising the blood-brain barrier resulting in
          additional
          fluid on brain = <b>edema</b>. </p>
        <p>2.
          Blunt force trauma can also cause neurological
          deficits.</p>
        <p>3.
          Neurodegenerative diseases, developmental, and
          other disorders </p>
        <p>a. <b><u>Alzheimer’s disease</u></b> = a progressive
          disorder characterized by the loss of higher cerebral functions and is
          the most
          common cause of senile dementia or senility. Symptoms may appear at 50
          – 60
          years or age. Associated with ACh shortages, shrinkage of the gyri,
          and
          formation of neural tangles among the CNS neurons and Alzheimer
          plaques within
          the cerebrum.</p>
        <p>b. <b><u>Parkinson’s disease</u></b> = neurodegenerative
          disorder of the substantia nigra resulting in decreased production of
          dopamine. The basal nuclei become more active, which raises skeletal
          muscle
          tone and produces rigidity and stiffness. Individuals, with Parkinson
          disease
          have difficulty starting voluntary movements, because opposing muscle
          groups do
          not relax; they must be overpowered. Once a movement is underway,
          every aspect
          must be voluntarily controlled through intense effort and
          concentration. </p>
        <p>c. <b><u>Huntington’s disease</u></b> = genetic disorder of
          the basal nuclei result in too much movements. occurs 1 in 20,000
          births and is
          the result of a dominant gene located on chromosome 4. Causes a
          progressive
          neurological degeneration leading to death within 20 years from onset
          of symptoms.
          Symptoms show in 20s or 30-40 years of age. </p>
        <p>d. <b><u>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</u></b> =
          progressive, degenerative disorder that affects the motor neurons in
          the spinal
          cord, brain stem, and cerebral hemispheres. The degeneration affects
          both
          upper and lower motor neurons. Because a motor neuron and its
          dependent muscle
          fibers are so intimately related, the destruction of the CNS neurons
          causes
          atrophy of the associated skeletal muscles.</p>
        <p>e. <b><u>Rabies</u></b> – A bite from a rabid animal
          injects the rabies virus into the peripheral tissues, where virus
          particles
          quickly enter the synaptic knobs. Retrograde flow then carries the
          virus into
          the CNS, with potential fatal consequences. Many toxins (including
          heavy
          metals), some pathogenic bacteria, and other viruses also bypass CNS
          defenses
          by exploiting axoplasmic transport.</p>
        <p>f.
          <b><u>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</u></b> = autoimmune disease causing
          deterioration of the myeline that affects
          axons in the optic nerve, brain, and spinal cord. MS results in
          paralysis and
          potentially death. The disorder is progressive and functional
          impairment
          increases following each new incident. Women are 1.5 times more likely
          to have
          MS than men.</p>
        <p>g. <b><u>Cerebral Palsy</u></b> – refers to a number of
          disorders that affect voluntary motor performance; they appear during
          infancy
          or childhood and persist throughout the life of affected individuals.
          The
          cause may be trauma associated with premature or unusually stressful
          birth, maternal
          exposure to drugs, or a genetic defect that causes the improper
          development of
          motor pathways.</p>
        <p>h. <b><u>Referred Pain</u></b> – the sensation of pain in a
          part of the body other than its actual source. </p>

        <h2>16.2 The Mental Status Exam</h2>
        <p>A. Functions of the cerebral cortex </p>
        <p>The cerebrum is the seat of many
          of the higher mental functions, such as memory and learning, language,
          and
          conscious perception, which are the subjects of subtests of the mental
          status
          exam. As discussed in Ch. 13 the cerebrum is a thin layer of gray
          material
          about 1 mm thick that is highly folded. Brodmann first described about
          50
          different regions of the cerebrum that correspond to their various
          functions.
          There are three types of processing regions: </p>
        <p>1. <b>Primary</b> = The primary
          cortical areas are where sensory information is initially processed,
          or where
          motor commands emerge to go to the brain stem or spinal cord.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Association</b> = Association
          areas are adjacent to primary areas and further process the
          modality-specific
          input.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Integration</b> areas =
          Multimodal integration areas are found where the modality-specific
          regions
          meet; they can process multiple modalities together or different
          modalities on
          the basis of similar functions, such as spatial processing in vision
          or
          somatosensation. Example of picking up a glass and based on what is in
          it
          determines what body movements we make.</p>
        <p>B. Cognitive Abilities:</p>
        <p>1. Orientation and Memory</p>
        <p><b>a. </b><b>Orientation</b> = the patient’s awareness of his
          or her immediate circumstances.</p>
        <p>i.
          <b>Awareness
            of time </b>= date.
          “Do you know what day it is?”</p>
        <p><b>ii.
          </b><b>Awareness
            of place </b>=
          location of where they are and why as well as who they are. “Do you
          know where
          you are?,” “What is your name?,” “Who is the current president?”</p>
        <p><b>b. </b><b>Memory</b> = the patient’s ability to recall
          information. Memory is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along
          with
          structures beneath the cerebral cortex such as the hippocampus and the
          amygdala. Short term memory can be assessed using the three-word test.
          Patients
          are given three words (ex. Book, clock, train) and after a brief time
          period
          are asked to recall the three words. Amnesia can be defined as losing
          memories
          of events of the past <b>retrograde amnesia</b> or inability to make
          future
          memories <b>anterograde amnesia.</b></p>
        <p>2. Language and Speech</p>
        <p>a. <b>Language</b> is at the core of what it means to be
          self-aware. Asking the patient to perform a set of actions can assess
          the
          ability to understand language. “Use you right pointer finger to touch
          the tip
          of your nose and then your left elbow.” Often, language deficits can
          be determined without specific
          subtests; if a person cannot reply to a question properly, there may
          be a
          problem with the reception of language. <b>Aphasia</b> is the loss or
          speech or
          language.</p>
        <p>b. Speech</p>
        <p>1. <b>Broca’s area</b> = responsible for speech
          production. <b>Expressive aphasia</b> = speech production is
          compromised
          leading to broken or haulted speech with incorrect grammar usage. </p>
        <p>2. <b>Wernicke’s area </b>= responsible for processing
          or understanding speech.<b> Receptive aphasia </b>= patients do not
          understand
          what is said to them or what they are saying even when they are
          talking.<b> </b></p>
        <p>3. <b>Conduction aphasia </b>= patient’s inability to
          connect understanding of speech to production of speech.<b>
          </b>Symptoms
          include inability to faithfully repeat spoken language. </p>
        <p>3. <b>Sensorium</b> = the parts of the brain involved in
          reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli. From the primary
          cortical
          areas of the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and gustatory senses to
          the
          association areas that process information in these modalities, the
          cerebral
          cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception. Two subtests
          assess
          specific functions of these cortical areas.</p>
        <p>a. <b>Praxis</b> = a practical exercise in which the
          patient performs a task completely on the basis of verbal description
          without
          any demonstration from the examiner. For example, the patient can be
          told to
          take their left hand and place it palm down on their left thigh, then
          flip it
          over so the palm is facing up, and then repeat this four times. </p>
        <p>b. <b>Gnosis</b> – sensory perception involving two
          processes. </p>
        <p>
          i.
          <b>Stereognosis</b> = involves the naming of objects
          strictly on the basis of the somatosensory information that comes from
          manipulating them with their eyes closed.</p>
        <p><b> ii.
          </b><b>Graphesthesia
          </b>= recognize
          numbers or letters written on the palm of the hand with a dull
          pointer, such as
          a pen cap.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Judgment and Abstract reasoning</b> = Making
          judgments and reasoning in the abstract are necessary to produce
          movements as
          part of larger responses. “When your alarm goes off, do you hit the
          snooze
          button or jump out of bed?” Is 10 extra minutes in bed worth the extra
          rush to
          get ready for your day? Will hitting the snooze button multiple times
          lead to
          feeling more rested or result in a panic as you run late? The
          prefrontal cortex
          is related to personality</p>
        <p><b>16.3 The Cranial Nerve Exam </b>allows directed<b> </b>tests of
          forebrain and brain stem structures</p>
        <p>A. Sensory Nerves</p>
        <p>1. The olfactory nerve (CN I) receives sense of smell</p>
        <p>2. Optic nerve (CNII) receives sense of vision. Testing vision relies
          on
          the tests that are common in an optometry office such as the
          <b>Snellen
            chart. </b>Testing the extent of the visual field means that the
          examiner can
          establish the boundaries of peripheral vision as simply as holding
          their hands
          out to either side and asking the patient when the fingers are no
          longer
          visible without moving the eyes to track them. Physical inspection of
          the
          optic disk, or where the optic nerve emerges from the eye, can be
          accomplished
          by looking through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.</p>
        <p>3. Vestibulocochlear nerves (CN VIII) receives sense of equilibrium
          and
          hearing. Problems with balance, such as vertigo, and deficits in
          hearing may
          both point to problems with the inner ear. Problems with hearing can
          be
          assessed using a tuning fork to determine types of hearing loss:</p>
        <p>a. <b>Conductive hearing</b> = relies on vibrations being
          conducted through the ossicles of the middle ear. </p>
        <p>b. <b>Sensorineural hearing = </b>relies on the transmission of
          sound stimuli through the neural components of the inner ear and
          cranial nerve.</p>
        <p>c. The<b> Rinne test </b>uses a
          vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and the patient
          indicates when the sound produced from this is no longer present. Then
          the fork
          is immediately moved to just next to the ear canal so the sound
          travels through
          the air. If the sound is not heard through the ear, meaning the sound
          is
          conducted better through the temporal bone than through the ossicles,
          a
          conductive hearing deficit is present.</p>
        <p>d. The <b>Webber</b> <b>test</b> also uses a tuning fork to
          differentiate
          between conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss. In this test,
          the tuning
          fork is placed at the top of the skull, and the sound of the tuning
          fork
          reaches both inner ears by travelling through bone. In a healthy
          patient, the
          sound would appear equally loud in both ears. With unilateral
          conductive
          hearing loss, however, the tuning fork sounds louder in the ear with
          hearing
          loss. This is because the sound of the tuning fork has to compete with
          background
          noise coming from the outer ear, but in conductive hearing loss, the
          background
          noise is blocked in the damaged ear, allowing the tuning fork to sound
          relatively louder in that ear. With unilateral sensorineural hearing
          loss,
          however, damage to the cochlea or associated nervous tissue means that
          the
          tuning fork sounds quieter in that ear.</p>
        <p>4. Taste sensation is relayed to the brain stem through fibers of the
          facial (CN VII) and glossopharyngeal nerves (CN IX) and the vagus
          nerve (X). </p>
        <p>5. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) is a mixed nerve that carries the
          general
          somatic senses from the head, similar to those coming through spinal
          nerves
          from the rest of the body. The primary sensory subtest for the
          trigeminal
          system is sensory discrimination. A cotton-tiped applicator, which is
          cotton
          attached to the end of a thin wooden stick, can be used easily for
          this. The
          wood of the applicator can be snapped so that a pointed end is
          opposite the
          soft cotton-tipped end. The cotton end provides a touch stimulus,
          while the
          pointed end provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus. While the
          patient’s eyes
          are closed, the examiner touches the two ends of the applicator to the
          patient’s face, alternating randomly between them. The patient must
          identify
          whether the stimulus is sharp or dull.</p>
        <p>B. Gaze Control</p>
        <p>The three nerves that control the
          extraocular muscles are the:</p>
        <p>1. Oculomotor (CN III) - Movement of eyelid and eyeball (via superior
          rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique), shape
          of lens,
          contracts pupil size</p>
        <p>2. Trochlear (CN IV) - Movement of eye by the superior oblique</p>
        <p>3. Abducens (CN VI) - Movement of the eyeball by the lateral
          rectus</p>
        <p>4. <b>Saccades</b> = rapid, conjugate movements of the eyes
          to survey a complicated visual stimulus, or to follow a moving visual
          stimulus.
          Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track
          the tip of
          a pen as it is passed through the visual field. </p>
        <p>5. <b>Diplopia</b>, or double vision, as the two eyes are temporarily
          pointed at different stimuli.</p>
        <p>6. <b>Convergence</b> = when the two eyes move to look
          at something closer to the face, they both adduct. To keep the
          stimulus in
          focus, the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens, which is
          controlled
          through the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve. The change
          in focal
          power of the eye is referred to as <b>accommodation</b>.
          Accommodation ability changes with age; focusing on nearer objects,
          such as the
          written text of a book or on a computer screen, may require corrective
          lenses
          later in life. Coordination of the skeletal muscles for convergence
          and
          coordination of the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for
          accommodation are
          referred to as the <b>accommodation–convergence
            reflex</b>.</p>
        <p>7. A crucial function of the cranial
          nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of the retina.
          The <b>vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)</b>coordinates
          all of the components, both sensory and motor, that make this
          possible</p>
        <p>C. Nerves of the Face and Oral
          Cavity</p>
        <p>The facial (CN VII) and
          glossopharyngeal (CN IX) nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the
          brain. The
          hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that controls the muscles of the
          tongue,
          except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is controlled by the vagus
          nerve.
          There are two sets of muscles of the tongue. The <b>extrinsic muscles
            of
            the tongue</b> are connected to other structures, whereas the
          <b>intrinsic
            muscles of the tongue</b> are completely contained within the
          lingual
          tissues. </p>
        <p>1. Facial nerve = controls muscles controlling facial expressions,
          secretion of saliva by the submandibular and sublingual glands and
          tears by the
          lacrimal gland, and sensory function for taste from the anterior 2/3
          of the
          tongue</p>
        <p>2. Glossopharyngeal = controls secretion of saliva by the parotid
          glands,
          elevation of pharynx during swallowing, and taste.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Aguesia</b> = loss of taste</p>
        <p>4. <b>Bells Palsy</b> = characterized by muscle weakness
          that causes one half of the face to droop. Bell’s palsy may be a
          reaction to a
          viral infection and usually resolves on its own within six months.</p>
        <p>5. These nerves can be tested by sticking out the tongue and saying
          “ah”</p>
        <p>D. Motor Nerves of the Neck</p>
        <p>The accessory nerve (CN XI)
          innervates the sternocleidomastoid (flex head forward and side to
          side) and
          trapezius muscles (extension and hyperextension of head as well as
          shrugging of shoulders).</p>
        <h2>16.4 The Sensory and Motor Exams</h2>
        <p>A. Sensory Modalities and Location</p>
        <p>1. Somatic senses are incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or
          tendons, whereas the visceral senses come from nervous tissue
          incorporated into
          the majority of organs such as the heart or stomach. </p>
        <p>2. The somatic senses are those that usually make up the conscious
          perception of the how the body interacts with the environment. </p>
        <p>3. The visceral senses are most often below the limit of conscious
          perception because they are involved in homeostatic regulation through
          the
          autonomic nervous system. </p>
        <p>4. Testing of the senses begins with examining the regions known as
          dermatomes that connect to the cortical region where somatosensation
          is
          perceived in the postcentral gyrus. </p>
        <p>5. To test the sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch
          of the
          soft end of a cotton-tipped applicator is applied at various locations
          on the
          skin. </p>
        <p>6. The <b>Romberg test</b> The patient is asked to stand straight
          with
          feet together then after achieving balance the patient closes their
          eyes and
          has to maintain the balance. </p>
        <p>B. Muscle Strength and Voluntary Movement</p>
        <p>1. The skeletomotor system is largely
          based on the simple, two-cell projection from the precentral gyrus of
          the
          frontal lobe to the skeletal muscles. Outputs from the frontal lobe
          synapse at
          the ventral horn motor neurons (Upper Motor Neuron UMN and Lower Motor
          Neuron
          LMN) before projecting to the skeletal muscle. </p>
        <p>2. The lack of muscle tone, known
          as <b>hypotonicity </b>or <b>flaccidity</b>, may indicate that the
          LMN is not conducting action potentials that will keep a basal level
          of
          acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.</p>
        <p>3. If muscle tone is present, muscle
          strength is tested by having the patient contract muscles against
          resistance.
          The examiner will ask the patient to lift the arm, for example, while
          the
          examiner is pushing down on it.</p>
        <p>4. Diseases that result in UMN
          lesions include cerebral palsy or MS, or it may be the result of a
          stroke. A
          sign of UMN lesion is a negative result in the subtest for <b>pronator
            drift</b>. </p>
        <p>5. The patient is asked to extend both
          arms in front of the body with the palms facing up. While keeping the
          eyes
          closed, if the patient unconsciously allows one or the other arm to
          slowly
          relax, toward the pronated position, this could indicate a failure of
          the motor
          system to maintain the supinated position.</p>
        <p>C. Reflexes</p>
        <p>See Ch. 15 reflex discussion on
          stretch reflex and superficial reflexes.</p>
        <p>1. For the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps,
          brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the leg, the
          knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex
          for the
          gastrocnemius and soleus. </p>
        <p>2.<b> Plantar reflex</b> that
          tests for the <b>Babinski sign</b> on the basis of the extension or
          flexion of the toes at the plantar surface of the foot. The plantar
          reflex is
          commonly tested in newborn infants to establish the presence of
          neuromuscular
          function. To elicit this reflex, an examiner brushes a stimulus,
          usually the
          examiner’s fingertip, along the plantar surface of the infant’s foot.
          An infant
          would present a positive Babinski sign, meaning the foot dorsiflexes
          and the
          toes extend and splay out. As a person learns to walk, the plantar
          reflex
          changes to cause curling of the toes and a moderate plantar flexion.
        </p>
        <p>D. Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron
          Damage</p>
        <p>1. Many of the tests of motor
          function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to
          the motor
          system is in the upper or lower motor neurons. Signs that suggest a
          UMN lesion
          include muscle weakness, strong deep tendon reflexes, decreased
          control of
          movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign,
          <b>spasticity</b>,
          and the <b>clasp-knife response</b>. Spasticity is an excess
          contraction
          in resistance to stretch. It can result in <b>hyperflexia</b>, which
          is
          when joints are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when
          the patient
          initially resists movement, but then releases, and the joint will
          quickly flex
          like a pocket knife closing.</p>
        <p>2. A lesion on the LMN would result in
          paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which
          is known
          as <b>paresis</b>. The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred
          to
          as <b>flaccid paralysis</b>, referring to a complete or partial loss
          of
          muscle tone, in contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in
          which tone is
          retained and spasticity is exhibited. Other signs of an LMN lesion
          are<b>fibrillation</b>, <b>fasciculation</b>,
          and compromised or lost reflexes resulting from the denervation of the
          muscle
          fibers</p>
        <p><b>16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams</b></p>
        <h3>A. Locations and Connections of the Cerebellum</h3>
        <p>1.
          <b><u>Cerebellum</u></b> =
          accounts for 11% of the brain’s mass.</p>
        <p>2.
          The cerebellum functions in the coordination and
          modulation of motor command from the cerebral cortex and maintaining
          balance
          and equilibrium.</p>
        <p>3.
          The cerebellum is partially hidden by the cerebral
          hemispheres and is the second largest structure in the brain.</p>
        <p>4.
          The cerebellum is separated from the cerebrum by
          the <b><u>transverse fissure</u></b>.</p>
        <p>5.
          The cerebellum also possesses fold-like wrinkles
          called <b><u>folia</u></b>, is divided into two hemispheres, and
          further
          subdivided into lobes: the <b>anterior lobe and posterior
            lobe</b>.</p>
        <p>6.
          The two cerebellar hemispheres are separated by the
          <b>vermis</b> while the anterior and posterior lobes are separated by
          <b><u>the
              primary fissure</u></b>.</p>
        <p>7.
          The white matter of the cerebellum is called the <b><u>arbor
              vitae</u></b> and is surrounded by gray matter called the
          <b><u>cerebellar
              cortex</u></b>.</p>
        <p>B. Coordination and Alternating
          Movement</p>
        <p>1.
          Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the
          coordination exam. The subtests target appendicular musculature,
          controlling
          the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment
          of
          cerebellar function will depend on the normal functioning of other
          systems
          addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor control
          from the
          cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and
          vestibular senses,
          are important to cerebellar function.</p>
        <p>2.
          The subtests that address appendicular musculature,
          and therefore the lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a
          check for
          tremor. The patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the
          position
          while the examiner watches for tremors.</p>
        <p>3.
          The <b>check reflex</b> depends on
          cerebellar input to keep increased contraction from continuing after
          the
          removal of resistance. The patient flexes the elbow against resistance
          from the
          examiner to extend the elbow. </p>
        <p>C. Posture and Gait</p>
        <p>1. Gait can either be considered a separate part of the neurological
          exam
          or a subtest of the coordination exam that addresses walking and
          balance. </p>
        <p>2. A subtest called station begins with the patient standing in a
          normal
          position to check for the placement of the feet and balance. The
          patient is
          asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain balance and
          posture
          during movement. </p>
        <p>3. Subtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally
          for a
          distance away from the examiner, and then turn and return to the
          starting
          position. The examiner watches for abnormal placement of the feet and
          the
          movement of the arms relative to the movement. The patient is then
          asked to
          walk with a few different variations. Tandem gait is when the patient
          places
          the heel of one foot against the toe of the other foot and walks in a
          straight
          line in that manner. Walking only on the heels or only on the toes
          will test
          additional aspects of balance.</p>
        <p>D. <b>Ataxia</b> = presents as a loss of coordination in
          voluntary movements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that
          cause
          balance problems, primarily in proprioception and equilibrium. Ataxia
          is often
          the result of exposure to exogenous substances (alcohol, ketamine or
          mercury),
          focal lesions (stroke, trauma, MS, or tumor), or a genetic
          disorder.</p>

        <p><b>17.1
          </b><b>An Introduction to the Endocrine System and
            Hormones. </b>The endocrine system works with or in
          harmony with the nervous system to control and coordinate all the
          activities of
          the body and to maintain homeostasis. <b>Endocrinology</b> - field of
          medicine
          that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.</p>
        <p>1. The endocrine system and nervous system are similar yet
          different:</p>
        <p>1.
          Both systems rely on the release of chemicals that
          bind to specific receptors on their target cells.</p>
        <p>2.
          Both share many chemical messengers; when released
          into the bloodstream they are called hormones but when released into a
          synapse,
          they are called neurotransmitters.</p>
        <p>3.
          Both systems are regulated primarily by negative
          feedback control.</p>
        <p>4.
          Both share a common goal: to preserve homeostasis
          by coordinating and regulating the activities of other cells, tissues,
          organs,
          and systems.</p>
        <p>2. Mechanisms of Intercellular Communication</p>
        <p>1.
          <b>Direct communication</b> –
          via <b>gap junctions</b>; use ions, small solutes, and other
          lipid-soluble
          materials as chemical mediators; effects are usually limited to
          adjacent cells
          of the same type that are interconnected by connexons.</p>
        <p>2.
          <b>Paracrine communication</b>
          – via <b>extracellular fluids</b>; use paracrine factors as chemical
          mediators;
          effects are primarily limited to the local area where paracrine factor
          concentrations are relatively high; target cells must have appropriate
          receptors.</p>
        <p>3.
          <b>Endocrine communication</b>
          – via the <b>bloodstream</b>; use hormones as chemical mediators;
          effects are
          on target cells located in other tissues or organs; target cells must
          have an
          appropriate receptor.</p>
        <p>4.
          <b>Neural communication</b> –
          via <b>synaptic clefts</b>; use neurotransmitters as chemical
          mediators;
          effects are limited to very specific areas; target cells must have
          appropriate
          receptors.</p>

          be transported throughout the body to regulate the metabolic functions
          and
          activities of other cells of the body. See table at end of outline for
          list of
          endocrine glands and their related hormones. </p>
        <p>A. Hormones and paracrine factors of the body can be divided into
          groups:</p>
        <p>1. <b>Amino acid derivatives</b> – hormones derived from
          a single amino acid. Examples include: the thyroid hormones such as
          thyroxine
          and triiodothyronine; the <b>catecholamines</b> such as epinephrine,
          norepinephrine, and dopamine; and melatonin</p>
        <p>2. <b>Peptide hormones</b> – chains of amino acids.
          Examples include: </p>
        <p>a. <b>Polypeptides</b>: antidiuretic hormone (9 amino
          acids) and oxytocin (9 amino acids) </p>
        <p>b. <b>Small proteins</b>: insulin (51 amino acids),
          growth hormone (191 amino acids) and prolactin (198 amino acids)</p>
        <p>c. <b>Glycoproteins</b>: thyroid-stimulating hormone,
          luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone</p>
        <p>3. <b>Lipid derivative</b>s – consist of carbon rings
          and side chains built either from fatty acids chains or
          cholesterol.</p>
        <p>a. <b>Eicosanoids</b> – built from fatty acid chains and
          include: leukotrienes and prostaglandins.</p>
        <p>b. <b>Steroid hormones</b> – built from cholesterol
          molecules and include: testosterone, estrogen and progesterone,
          corticosteroids, and calcitriol.</p>
        <p>B. Pathways of Hormone Action</p>
        <p>1. <b>Lipid-soluble</b> = A steroid hormone directly
          initiates the production of proteins within a target cell. Steroid and
          thyroid
          hormones easily diffuse through the cell membrane. The steroid hormone
          binds to
          its receptor in the cytosol, forming a receptor–hormone complex. The
          receptor–hormone complex then enters the nucleus and binds to the
          target gene
          on the DNA. Thyroid hormones bind to receptors already bound to DNA.
          Transcription of the gene creates a messenger RNA that is translated
          into the
          desired protein within the cytoplasm.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Water-soluble</b> = Water-soluble hormones cannot
          diffuse through the cell membrane. These hormones must bind to a
          surface
          cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cell- signaling
          pathway
          within the cell involving G proteins, adenylyl cyclase, the secondary
          messenger
          cyclic AMP (cAMP), and protein kinases. In the final step, these
          protein
          kinases phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates
          proteins in the
          cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone.</p>
        <p>C. Hormones
          are regulated by feedback mechanisms and hormonal interactions</p>
        <p>1.
          Factors Affecting Target Cell Response. Hormones
          must have receptors on their target tissue.</p>
        <p>a. <b>Downregulation</b> - the presence of a significant
          level of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target
          cells to
          decrease their number of receptors for that hormone, allowing cells to
          become
          less reactive to the excessive hormone levels.</p>
        <p>b. <b>Upregulation </b>- cells increase their number of
          receptors due to the level of a hormone becoming chronically
          reduced.</p>
        <p>2.
          Interactions between hormones:</p>
        <p>a. <b>Antagonistic effects</b> - one hormone inhibits
          the response of another therefore they generate opposite responses;
          example:
          insulin lowers blood sugar while glucagon raises blood sugar</p>
        <p>b. <b>Synergistic effects</b> - two hormones with
          similar effects produce an amplified response. In some cases, two
          hormones are
          required for an adequate response. For example, two different
          reproductive
          hormones—FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the
          ovaries—are required
          for the maturation of female ova (egg cells).</p>
        <p>c. <b>Permissive effects</b> - one hormone is needed to
          activate another; example: rennin stimulates the conversion of
          Angiotensin I
          into Angiotensin II</p>
        <p>3.
          Feedback mechanisms</p>
        <p>a. <b>Negative feedback systems</b> - physiological
          response causes a decrease in the release of the hormone; most
          commonly used</p>
        <p>b. <b>Positive feedback systems</b> - physiological
          response causes an increase in the release of the hormone; rarely
          used</p>
        <p>D. Role
          of endocrine gland stimuli: Hormones can stimulate behavior or
          behavior may
          stimulate hormones. Elevated hormone levels do not equate to elevated
          behavior.
        </p>

        <p>17.3 Hypothalamus and Pituitary</p>
        <p>A. Hypothalmus</p>
        <p>1.
          The hypothalamus provides the highest level of
          endocrine control. It integrates the activities of the nervous system
          and
          endocrine system. </p>
        <p>2.
          The hypothalamus accomplishes this integration
          through three mechanisms:</p>
        <p>a. The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that exert direct
          neural
          control of the endocrine cells, called chromaffin cells, of the
          adrenal
          medulla. When the sympathetic division is activated, this direct
          control
          allows the immediate stimulation of the adrenal gland. </p>
        <p>b. Hypothalamic neurons synthesize two hormones – ADH and OXT – and
          transport them along axons within the infundibulum to the posterior
          lobe of the
          pituitary for storage and secretion.</p>
        <p>c. The hypothalamus secretes regulatory hormones that control the
          secretions of the anterior pituitary gland. These regulatory hormones,
          called <b>releasing
            hormones</b> (RH) and <b>inhibiting hormones</b> (IH), flow via a
          network of
          fenestrated capillaries called the <b>hypophyseal portal
            system</b>.</p>
        <p>B. Pituitary Gland – Hypophysis</p>
        <p>1. Also known as the “master gland” is located within the <b>sella
            turcica</b>
          of the sphenoid bone.</p>
        <p>2. Connected to the hypothalamus via the infundibulum and a network
          of
          capillaries called the hypophyseal portal system. Divided into two
          lobes: an
          anterior lobe and a posterior lobe.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Neurohypophysis</b> – the posterior lobe of the
          pituitary gland connected to the hypothalamus by the
          <b>infundibulum</b>;
          contains the axons of the hypothalamic neurons. Stores and secretes
          hormones
          synthesized in the hypothalamus:</p>
        <p>a. <b>Antidiuretic hormone</b> (ADH also known as
          vasopressin) – increases water reabsorption within the renal tubules
          of the
          kidney. This results in a decrease in water loss from urine.</p>
        <p>b. <b>Oxytocin</b> (OXT) – stimulates the smooth muscle
          contractions of the uterus which initiates child birth. After
          delivery,
          stimulates the ejection of milk. In both sexes, known as the “cuddle
          hormone”
          as it surges during arousal and orgasm.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Adenohypophysis</b> – the anterior lobe of the
          pituitary gland connected to the hypothalamus by the <b>hypophyseal
            portal
            system</b>. Controlled by regulating hormones, called <b>releasing
            hormones</b>
          (RH) and <b>inhibiting hormones</b> (IH) from the hypothalamus:</p>
        <p>a. <b>Thyroid stimulating hormone</b> (TSH) – targets
          the thyroid gland; stimulates the thyroid to grow and increase its
          secretion of
          the thyroid hormones, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>. Released in
          response to
          thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from hypothalamus.</p>
        <p>b. <b>Adrenocorticotropic hormone</b> (ACTH or
          corticotropin) – stimulates the release of steroid hormones by the
          adrenal
          cortex. Released in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
          from the
          hypothalamus.</p>
        <p>c. <b>Follicle stimulating hormone</b> (FSH or
          gonadotropin) – promotes ovarian follicles to develop in females and,
          in
          conjunction with luteinizing hormone, stimulates the secretion of
          estrogens.
          In males FSH promotes the physical maturation in sperm. Released in
          response
          to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.</p>
        <p>d. <b>Luteinizing hormone</b> (LH) – induces ovulation
          in females and promotes the secretion of estrogen and progesterone. In
          males
          it stimulates the production of sex hormones called androgens,
          specifically
          testosterone. Released in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone
          from the
          hypothalamus.</p>
        <p>e. <b>Growth hormone</b> (GH) – stimulates cell growth
          and reproduction by accelerating the rate of protein synthesis
          particularly in
          skeletal muscle and bone. Regulated by growth hormone-releasing
          hormone
          (GH-RH) and growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GH-IH) from the
          hypothalamus.</p>
        <p>f.
          <b>Prolactin</b> (PRL or
          luteotropic hormone) – works with other hormones to stimulate mammary
          gland
          development and the production of milk during pregnancy and during
          nursing.
          Regulated by several prolactin-releasing hormones and
          prolactin-inhibiting
          hormone (PIH).</p>
        <p>g. <b>Melanocyte stimulating hormone</b> (MSH) –
          stimulates melanocytes of the skin to increase their production of
          melanin.
          Non-functional in adults.</p>

        <p>17.4
          Thyroid Gland</p>
        <p>A. Located in the neck just below the larynx and anterior to the
          trachea.
          Divided into a right and left lobe connected by a narrow
          <b>isthmus</b>.
          Regulated by TSH from the pituitary gland.</p>
        <p>B. The thyroid gland contains large numbers of <b>thyroid
            follicles</b> –
          hollow spheres lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium called the
          <b>follicle
            cells</b>. </p>
        <p>1. The follicle cells surround a cavity that holds a viscous
          <b>colloid</b>,
          a fluid containing a large quantity of dissolved proteins.</p>
        <p>2. The follicle cells synthesize a globular protein called
          <b>thyroglobulin</b>
          and secrete it into the colloid of the thyroid follicle. </p>
        <p>3. The thyroglobulin molecules contain the amino acid tyrosine. The
          thyroglobulin is combined with <b>iodide ions</b> absorbed from the
          diet to
          form the thyroid hormones: <b>T<sub>3</sub> (triiodothyronine)
          </b>and<b> T<sub>4</sub>
            (thyroxine)</b>.</p>
        <p>4. Thyroid hormones have several effects in the body:</p>
        <p>a. Stimulates red blood cell production and thus enhanced oxygen
          delivery.</p>
        <p>b. Stimulates the activity of other endocrine tissues.</p>
        <p>c. Accelerates the turnover of minerals in bone.</p>
        <p>d. Elevates rates of oxygen consumption and energy consumption in
          cells;
          increase basal metabolic rates.</p>
        <p>e. Increases heart rate and force of contraction resulting in
          increased
          blood pressure.</p>
        <p>f.
          Increases sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation.</p>
        <p>g. Maintains the normal sensitivity of respiratory centers to changes
          in
          oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood.</p>
        <p>C. Between
          the follicles is a second population of endocrine cells called
          <b>parafollicular
            cells</b>, or <b>C (clear) cells</b>. Clear cells produce
          <b>calcitonin</b>
          (CT) which lowers blood calcium levels when they are too high.
          Calcitonin
          works by increasing the amount of calcium excreted in urine and
          increasing the
          deposition of calcium in bone by stimulating <b>osteoblast</b>
          activity.</p>

        <p>17.5 Parathyroid Gland</p>
        <p>A. Two pair of glands embedded in the posterior surfaces of the
          thyroid
          gland.</p>
        <p>B. Composed of two cell populations</p>
        <p>1. <b>Oxyphil cells</b> – have no known function.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Chief cells</b> – produce <b>parathyroid hormone</b>
          (PTH) which increases blood calcium levels when they are too low.</p>
        <p>C. PTH
          and calcitonin work as antagonists to maintain homeostasis of blood
          calcium
          levels. PTH specifically targets:</p>
        <p>1. Bones – activates <b>osteoclasts</b> causing calcium and phosphate
          ions
          to be released into the blood.</p>
        <p>2. Intestine – increases calcium absorption from food.</p>
        <p>3. Kidneys – promotes activation of vitamin D and increases calcium
          reabsorption in the kidney tubules.</p>

        <p>17.6
          Adrenal Gland</p>
        <p>A. Located retroperitoneal and superior to the kidney. Composed of
          two
          distinct regions: the adrenal cortex (outer) and adrenal medulla
          (inner).</p>
        <p>B. <b>Adrenal cortex</b> produces steroid hormones from
          cholesterol (<b>corticosteroids</b>) and is divided into three
          regions:</p>
        <p>1. <b>Zona glomerulosa</b> (outer) – releases
          <i>mineralocorticoids</i>,
          principally <b>aldosterone</b>, which controls electrolyte balance in
          the
          kidneys.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Zona fasciculate</b> (middle) – produces <i>glucocorticoids</i>
          such as <b>cortisol</b> and <b>cortisone</b> which influence
          metabolism of
          glucose, protein, and fat; controlled by ACTH.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Zona reticularis</b> (inner) – produces <i>androgens</i>
          or <i>adrenal</i> <i>sex</i> <i>hormones</i> such as
          <b>testosterone</b> which
          influence masculinization.</p>
        <p>C. <b>Adrenal medulla</b> releases hormones when the
          body is under stress and consists of hormone-producing cells called
          <b>chromaffin</b>
          <b>cells</b>.</p>
        <p>1. <b>Epinephrine (aka adrenaline)</b> – (80%) elevates blood sugar,
          regulates body during stress or anger;
          raises blood pressure, heart beat, glycogen breakdown and increases
          all other
          sympathetic effects of the nervous system. </p>
        <p>2. <b>Norepinephrine</b> <b>(aka noradrenaline</b>) – helps maintain
          blood pressure, and accounts for 20% of the hormones
          released by the medullary portion of the adrenal gland.</p>
        <p>3. Effects of Epi/NE:</p>
        <p>a. Signals the liver and skeletal muscle cells to convert glycogen
          into
          glucose, resulting in increased blood glucose levels. </p>
        <p>b. These hormones increase the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure
          to
          prepare the body to fight the perceived threat or flee from it. </p>
        <p>c. Dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels. </p>
        <p>d. Prompts vasodilation, further increasing the oxygenation of
          important
          organs such as the lungs, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle.</p>
        <p>e. Triggers vasoconstriction to blood vessels serving less essential
          organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skin, and
          downregulates
          some components of the immune system.</p>
        <p>f.
          Other effects include a dry mouth, loss of
          appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of peripheral vision.</p>

        <p>17.7 Pineal Gland</p>
        <p>A. Located in the roof of the 3<sup>rd</sup> ventricle of the brain
          called
          the <b>epithalamus</b> region.</p>
        <p>B. Composed of special secretory cells called
          <b>pinealocytes</b>.</p>
        <p>C. The major product is <b>melatonin</b> whose concentrations rise
          and
          fall in a diurnal cycle. Levels are lowest during daylight hours and
          highest
          at night.</p>
        <p>1. Melatonin appears to maintain the basic <b>circadian rhythms</b> –
          daily changes in physiological processes that follow a regular
          day-night
          pattern.</p>
        <p>2. Melatonin protects against tissue damage by acting as an
          <b>antioxidant</b>
          and that protects the central nervous system from <b>free radicals</b>
          such as
          hydrogen peroxide.</p>
        <p>3. Melatonin may inhibit reproductive development and
          functioning.</p>
        <p><b><u> </u></b></p>
        <p>17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones</p>
        <p>A. <b>Ovaries</b>: located in the pelvic cavity.
          Produce <b>estrogen</b> which regulates secondary sex characteristics
          (breast,
          pubic hair, etc.). Also produce <b>progesterone</b> which helps to
          stimulate
          the uterus to bring about thickening and vascularization of the
          endometrium in
          preparation for implantation of a fertilized egg.</p>
        <p>B. <b>Testes</b>: located in the scrotum. Secretes
          <b>testosterone</b>,
          the male sex hormone, which brings about development of secondary sex
          characteristics, normal sex behaviors, and production of sperm. Also
          produces <b>inhibin</b>
          which inhibits the release of FSH and GnRH when sperm counts are
          high.</p>
        <p>C. <b>Placenta</b>: a temporary organ only formed
          during pregnancy. Produces <b>hCG</b> hormone (human chorionic
          gonadotrophic)
          with aid in maintaining pregnancy and keeping the corpus luteum
          intact.</p>
        <p><b><u> </u></b></p>
        <p>17.9
          The Endocrine Pancreas</p>
        <p>A. Located posterior and inferior to the stomach. A unique organ that
          has
          both and endocrine and exocrine abilities.</p>
        <p>B. <b>Islets of Langerhans</b>: <i>endocrine</i> cells
          that produce hormones.</p>
        <p>1. Alpha cells – produce glucagon </p>
        <p>2. Beta cells – produce insulin </p>
        <p>3. <b>Delta cells</b> – produce <b>somatostatin</b>
          which inhibits insulin and glucagon secretion and slows the rates of
          food
          absorption and enzyme secretion along the digestive tract.</p>
        <p>4. <b>PP cells</b> – produce the hormone <b>pancreatic
            polypeptide</b> (PP) which inhibits gallbladder contractions and
          regulates the
          production of some of the digestive enzymes.</p>
        <p>C. <b>Acinar cells</b>: <i>exocrine</i> cells that
          produce enzymes and other digestive chemicals. (must know for GI

        <p>1. <b>Sodium bicarbonate</b> – serves as a buffer of the
          HCl produced in the stomach.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Proteases</b> – secreted as inactive enzymes but
          become activated in the small intestine to form the activated:
          <b>carboxypeptidase</b>,
          <b>chymotrypsin</b>, and <b>trypsin</b>. These enzymes break down
          large
          polypeptides into oligopeptides, tripeptides, dipeptides and some
          amino acids. </p>
        <p>3. <b>Pancreatic amylase</b> (almost identical to
          salivary amylase) – enzymes that further digest the carbohydrates,
          only briefly
          started in the mouth, into oligosaccharides and disaccharides.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Pancreatic lipase</b> – enzyme that breaks down
          lipids into fatty acids and glycerol.</p>
        <p>5. <b>Pancreatic nucleases</b> – enzymes that breaks
          down nucleic acids such as deoxyribonuclease (DNA) and ribonuclease
          (RNA).</p>
        <p>D. Insulin
          and glucagon work as antagonists to maintain homeostasis of blood
          sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing membrane
          transport of
          glucose into body cells, converting excess glucose to glycogen for
          short-term
          storage (glycogenesis) and into fat for long-term storage in
          adipocytes
          (lipogenesis). </p>
        <p>2. Glucagon raises blood glucose levels by breaking down glycogen
          into
          glucose (glycogenolysis), synthesizes glucose from lactic acid and
          other
          non-carbohydrate molecules (gluconeogenesis), and releases glucose to
          the blood
          by liver cells.</p>

          Organs with secondary endocrine function</p>
        <p>A. <b>Heart</b> secretes <b>ANP</b> that literally means
          “producing salty urine. ANP Inhibits aldosterone release by the
          adrenal
          cortex. The brain also secretes <b>BNP </b>that performs the same
          job.</p>
        <p>B. Gastrointestinal tract possesses cells that produce secretin,
          gastrin,
          CCK, GIP, VIP, ghrelin, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and many more.</p>
        <p>C. <b>Kidney </b>secretes<b> EPO</b> for red blood cell
          production and <b>rennin</b> for activation of angiotensin II, a
          potent
          vasoconstrictor.</p>
        <p>D. <b>Skeleton</b> produces at least two hormones:<b> </b></p>
        <p>1. <b>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23</b>) is
          produced by bone cells to triggers the kidneys to inhibit the
          formation of
          calcitriol from vitamin D3 and to increase phosphorus excretion during
          high
          blood calcium levels. </p>
        <p>2. <b>Osteocalcin</b>, produced by osteoblasts,
          stimulates the pancreatic beta cells to increase insulin production.
          It also
          acts on peripheral tissues to increase their sensitivity to insulin
          and their
          utilization of glucose.</p>
        <p>E. <b>Adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> releases <b>leptin</b>
          following the uptake of glucose and lipids resulting in satiety.</p>
        <p>F. <b>Skin</b> produces <b>cholecalciferol</b>, the
          inactive form of vitamin D.</p>
        <p>G. <b>Thymus Gland</b>: located
          posterior to the sternum and between the lungs. Large in infant,
          increases in
          size until puberty and then shrinks as the individual continues to
          age. The
          major hormonal product of the thymus gland is <b>thymosin</b> which
          appears to
          be essential for the normal development of T lymphocytes and the
          immune
          response.</p>
        <p>H. <b>Liver</b> is responsible for secreting at least
          four important hormones or hormone precursors: </p>
        <p>1. <b>Insulin-like growth factor (somatomedin</b>) is
          the immediate stimulus for growth in the body, especially of the
          bones.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Angiotensinogen</b> is the precursor to
          angiotensin, mentioned earlier, which increases blood pressure.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Thrombopoetin</b> stimulates the production of the
          blood’s platelets.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Hepcidin</b> blocks the release of iron from cells
          in the body, helping to regulate iron homeostasis in our body
          fluids.<b> </b></p>

          Development and Aging of the Endocrine System</p>
        <p>A. Development: The endocrine system arises from all three embryonic
          germ
          layers. </p>
        <p>1.
          Endoderm: thyroid and parathyroid glands, as well
          as the pancreas and the thymus.</p>
        <p>2.
          Mesoderm: The endocrine glands that produce the
          steroid hormones, such as the gonads and adrenal cortex</p>
        <p>3.
          Ectoderm: pituitary gland, pineal gland, adrenal
          medulla</p>
        <p>B. Aging</p>
        <p>As the body ages, changes occur
          that affect the endocrine system, sometimes altering the production,
          secretion,
          and catabolism of hormones. For example, the structure of the anterior
          pituitary gland changes as vascularization decreases and the
          connective tissue
          content increases with increasing age. This restructuring affects the
          gland’s
          hormone production. Certain hormones and gland production decrease
          with
          age: reduced cortisol and aldosterone from adrenal gland, lower
          estrogen and
          progesterone from ovaries, as well as lower testosterone levels. </p>

Within the lumen of the proximal tubule, HCO three minus is combining with an H plus ion that enters the lumen from a proximal tubule cell. This reaction forms H two CO three. H two CO three then breaks into H two O and CO two, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. The CO two then moves from the lumen of the proximal tubule into one of the proximal tubule cells. There, the reaction runs in reverse, with CO two combining with H two O to form H two CO three. The H two CO three then splits into H plus and HCO three minus. The H plus moves into the lumen, reinitiating the first step of the loop. The HCO three minus leaves the proximal tubule cell and enters the blood stream."
