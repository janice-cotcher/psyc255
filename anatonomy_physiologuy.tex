The cranial cavity is a large, bean-shaped cavity filling most of the upper skull where the brain is located. The vertebral cavity is a very narrow, thread-like cavity running from the cranial cavity down the entire length of the spinal cord. Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity. The thoracic cavity consists of three cavities that fill the interior area of the chest. The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone. The superior mediastinum is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities. The pericardial cavity within the mediastinum is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart. The diaphragm divides the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity. Together the abdominal and pelvic cavity can be referred to as the abdominopelvic cavity while the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities together can be referred to as the ventral body cavity."\textgreater{} \textless img src="/resources/31b2c67b26e49d57f60ae5244033f5b4a0e7da6b" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="This illustration shows a lateral and anterior view of the body and highlights the body cavities with different colors.

Ectoderm gives rise to epidermis, glands on the skin, some cranial bones, the pituitary and adrenal medulla, the nervous system, the tissue between the cheeks and gums, and the anus. This row contains three pictures. The leftmost picture illustrates several layers of yellow, oval-shaped skin cells with purple nuclei. The middle diagram shows a neuron, which is a yellow, star shaped cell with finger like branches at its corners. The neuron also has a purple nucleus and a yellow tube that connects to the bottom of the cell. The right image in this row shows a brown pigment cell embedded at the bottom layer of several skin cells. It is secreting dark-colored pigment into the skin cells from tentacle-like projections. The germ layer in the second row is mesoderm. Mesoderm gives rise to connective tissues, bone, cartilage, blood, the endothelium of blood vessels, muscle, synovial membranes, serous membranes that line body cavities, the kidneys, and the lining of the gonads. Five images are given in this row to illustrate. The leftmost image is cardiac muscle, which is cylindrical and curved. There are many open spaces between neighboring cardiac muscles. The next image shows skeletal muscle, which is a series of closely stacked cylinders with well defined horizontal striping. The middle image shows three tubule cells of the kidney, which are square shaped and contain a brown nucleus. The fourth image shows a series of red blood cells, which are red and saucer shaped with a slight depression at the center. The fifth image shows smooth muscles which are tightly packed, diamond shaped cells with oval-shaped nuclei. Endoderm gives rise to the lining of the airways and digestive system (except the mouth and distal part of digestive system). Also, the rectum and anal canal, digestive glands, endocrine glands, and adrenal cortex all develop from endoderm. The leftmost image in this row shows a lung cell, which is a large, purple, trapezoid-shaped cell.

\includegraphics[width=6.08073in,height=4.69792in,alt={This table shows the different types of exocrine glands: alveolar (acinar) versus tubular and those with simple ducts versus compound ducts. Each diagram shows a single layer of columnar epithelial cells with a line of cells travelling along the surface of a tissue (surface epithelium) and then dipping into a hole in the tissue. The cells travel down the right side of the hole until they reach the bottom, then curve around the bottom of the hole and then travel up the left side. Finally, the cells emerge back onto the surface of the tissue. The surface epithelial cells are those that are on the surface of the tissue; the duct cells are those that line both walls of the hole. The gland cells are those that line the bottom of the hole. The shape of the hole differs in each gland. In the simple alvelolar (acinar) gland, the duct and gland cells are bulb shaped with the gland cells being the larger end of the bulb. Simple alveolar glands are not found in adults, as these represent an early developmental stage of simple, branched glands. In simple tubular glands, the duct and gland cells are U shaped. Simple tubular glands are found in the intestinal glands. In simple branched alveolar glands, the gland cells form three bulbs at the end of the duct, similar in appearance to a clover leaf. The sebaceous (oil) glands are examples of simple branched alveolar glands. In simple coiled tubular glands, the duct and gland cells form a U, however, the bottom of the U, which is all gland cells, is curved up to the right. Merocrine sweat glands are examples of simple coiled tubular glands. In simple branched tubular glands, the duct is very short and the gland cells divide into three lobes, similar in appearance to a bird's foot. The gastric glands of the stomach and mucous glands of the esophagus, tongue and duodenum are examples of simple branched tubular glands. Among the glands with compound ducts, compound alveolar (acinar) glands have three sets of clover leaf bulbs, for a total of six bulbs. Two of the clover leaf shaped structures extend parallel to the surface epithelium in opposite directions to each other. The third clover leaf extends down into the tissue, perpendicular to the surface. The duct is cross-shaped. The mammary glands are an example of compound alveolar glands. Compound tubular glands have a similar structure to compound alveolar glands. However, instead of three cloverleaf shaped bulbs, the compound tubular gland has three bird's foot shaped bulbs. The duct is also cross-shaped in the compound tubular gland. The mucous glands of the mouth and the bulbourethral glands of the male reproductive system are examples of compound tubular glands, which are also found in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Compound tubuloalveolar glands are a hybrid between the compound alveolar gland and the compound tubular gland. The two sets of bulbs that run parallel to the surface are bird-foot shaped; however, the set of bulbs that runs perpendicularly below the surface is cloverleaf shaped. The salivary glands, glands of the respiratory passages and glands of the pancreas are all compound tubuloalveolar glands." width="550" id="13"\textgreater{}}]{images/media/image32.png}

\includegraphics[width=3.47656in,height=3.54278in,alt={These three diagrams show the three modes of secretion. All three diagrams show three orange cells in a line with attached to a basement membrane. Each cell has a large nucleus in its lower half. The upper half of each cell contains a Golgi apparatus, which appears like an upside down jellyfish. Yellow secretory vesicles are budding from the top end of the Golgi apparatus. Each vesicle contains several orange circles, which are the secreted substance. In merocrine secretion, the secretory vesicles travel to the top edge of the cells and release the secretion from the cell by melding with the cell membrane. In apocrine secretion, the top third of the cell, which contains the secretory vesicles, pinches in at the sides and then completely disconnects above the Golgi complex. The pinched off portion of the cell is the secretion, as it contains the majority of the secretory vesicles. In holocrine secretion, the upper third of the cell, just above the Golgi complex, forms many finger like projections. Each projection contains several vesicles. The tips of the projections that contain secretory vesicles bud off from the cell. In this method of secretion, the mature cell eventually dies and becomes the secretory product." width="400" id="15"\textgreater{}}]{images/media/image33.png}

At the base of the cross section, an artery runs horizontally through fatty tissue below the dermis. Several small capillaries branch from the artery and travel into the upper regions of the dermis. In the first step of healing, inflammatory chemicals, symbolized with green dots, are released from the injury site. The chemicals travel through the dermis and enter the horizontal artery. Clotting proteins and plasma proteins also initiate clotting within the wound, forming a scab, which is clearly visible in the second step as a black and brown mass covering the upper regions of the wound. Below the scab, epithelial cells in the epidermis multiply and begin to fill in the wound. In the dermis, three fibrocytes are binding the wound area with white tissue. This tissue is granulation tissue. Laying down granulation tissue restores the vascular supply, as indicated by capillaries growing around the wounded area. In the third step, the scab is gone and the epidermis has grown in and contracted to seal the upper portion of the wound.

\item
  Stratum Basale

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    The deepest epidermal layer consisting of a single row of
    \textbf{basal cells}, or germinative cells, that are undergoing
    rapid mitotic divisions. These cells are sometimes called stem cells
    because their mitotic divisions replace the more superficial
    keratinocytes that are lost or shed at the surface.
  \item
    Hemidesmosomes attach the cells of this layer to the basal lamina
    that separates the epidermis from the areolar tissue of the adjacent
    papillary layer of the dermis.
  \item
    Approximately 10 -- 25\% of cells in this layer are melanocytes
    which produce \textbf{melanin}, a brown, yellowish-brown, or black
    skin pigment.
  \item
    In hairless skin, specialized cells called \textbf{merkel cells}
    exist in small numbers. These cells are sensitive to touch and when
    compressed, they release chemicals that stimulate sensory nerve
    endings.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Stratum Spinosum
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Consists of approximately 8 -- 10 layers of keratinocytes bound
  together by desmosomes and microfilaments of pre-keratin.
\item
  The name \emph{stratum spinosum}, which means ``spiny layer'', refers
  to the fact that the cells look like miniature pincushions in standard
  histological sections.
\item
  Large numbers of \textbf{dendritic cells} are found in this layer.
  These are specialized cells that participate in the immune response by
  stimulating a defense mechanism against 1) microorganisms that manage
  to penetrate the superficial layers of the epidermis and 2)
  superficial skin cancers.

  layer''.
\item
  These cells become flattened, the plasma membrane becomes less
  permeable, and the organelles deteriorate.
\item
  By the time the cells reach this layer, most have stopped dividing and

  the stratum corneum from deeper layers.
\item
  The cells of this layer are flattened, densely packed, largely devoid
  of organelles, and filled with the proteins keratin and keratohyalin.
\item
  By the time they reach the stratum lucidum, the cells are dead and
  undergoing dehydration.

  Outermost layer of keratinocytes (sometimes called the ``horny
  layer'').
\item
  A broad zone of 15 -- 30 layers of keratinized cells that accounts for
  up to three-quarters of the epidermal thickness.
\item
  Keratinization is the formation of protective, superficial layers of
  cells filled with keratin.
\item
  The dead cells in each layer of the stratum corneum remain tightly
  interconnected by desmosomes. It takes 7 to 10 days for a cell to move
  from the stratum basale to the stratum corneum. The dead cells
  generally remain in the exposed stratum corneum for an additional two
  weeks before they are shed or washed away.
\item

\item
  The deeper layers of the epidermis form \textbf{\ul{epidermal ridges}}
  which extend into the dermis and are adjacent to the dermal
  projections called \textbf{dermal papillae} that project upward to the
  epidermis. These ridges and papillae are significant because they
  greatly increase the surface area for attachment, firmly binding the
  epidermis to the dermis.
\item
  The ridge patterns in the thick skin on the surface of the fingertips
  produce fingerprints, which have been used to identify individuals in
  criminal investigations for more than a century.
\item
  Like all other epithelia, the epidermis lacks local blood vessels.
  Epidermal cells rely of the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from
  capillaries within the dermis. As a result the cells with the highest
  metabolic demand are closest to the underlying dermis

      areolar tissue with all of the typical cell types within it.

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv}.}
      \item
        This layer also contains the capillaries, lymphatic vessels, and
        sensory neurons that supply the surface of the skin.
      \item
        The papillary layer gets its name from the dermal papillae that
        project between the epidermal ridges.
      \item
        This layer nourishes and supports epidermis.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Reticular layer}} = consists of an interwoven meshwork
      of dense irregular connective tissue containing both collagen and
      elastic fibers.

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv}.}
      \item
        Bundles of collagen fibers extend superficially to blend into
        those of the papillary layer and deeply to blend with the
        hypodermis.
      \item
        The collagen fibers provide strength while the elastic fibers
        provide flexibility.
      \item
        This layer restricts the spread of pathogens, stores lipid
        reserves, attaches skin to deeper tissues, possesses sensory
        receptors, and contains blood vessels for temperature
        regulation.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Cleavage Lines}} = within the dermis, the collagen and
    elastin fibers are arranged in parallel bundles oriented to resist
    the forces applied to the skin during normal movements. The
    resulting pattern of fiber bundles establishes the lines of
    cleavage. These lines are clinically significant: a cut parallel to
    a cleavage line will usually remain closed and heal with little
    scarring whereas a cut at a right angle to a cleavage line will be
    pulled open as movement occurs and result in greater scarring.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

List the 2 major areas of the dermis and describe the characteristics of
each.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  The \textbf{hypodermis} separates the skin from deeper structures.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    It stabilizes the position of skin in relation to underlying tissues
    (such as skeletal muscles or other organs) while permitting
    independent movement.
  \item
    Because it is often dominated by adipose tissue, the hypodermis also
    represents an important site for 1) insulation, 2) cushioning, and
    3) the storage of energy reserves.
  \item
    At puberty men accumulate subcutaneous fat at the neck, on the arms,
    along the lower back, and over the buttock. In contrast, women
    accumulate subcutaneous fat at the breasts, buttocks, hips, and
    thighs. In both genders, there are almost no fat cells on the back
    of the hands and feet but distressingly large numbers in the
    abdominal regions (resulting in the ``potbelly'').
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Factors influencing \textbf{skin color} include epidermal pigmentation
  and dermal circulation.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\Alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    The color of one's skin is genetically programmed. However,
    increased pigmentation, or tanning, can result in response to
    ultraviolet radiation.
  \item
    Skin color is influenced by the presence of pigments in the
    epidermis:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Melanin}} = a brown, yellowish-brown, or black pigment
      produced by melanocytes.

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv}.}
      \item
        \textbf{\ul{Melanocytes}} are located within the stratum basale,
        squeezed between or deep to the keratinocytes. Melanocytes
        manufacture melanin from the amino acid \textbf{tyrosine}, and
        package it in intracellular vesicles called
        \textbf{\ul{melanosomes}}.
      \item
        Melanosomes travel within the processes of melanocytes and are
        transferred intact to keratinocytes. The transfer of
        pigmentation colors the keratinocyte temporarily, until the
        melanosomes are destroyed by fusion with lysosomes.
      \item
        In individuals with pale skin, this transfer occurs in the
        stratum basale and stratum spinosum, and the cells of more
        superficial layers lose their pigmentation. In dark-skinned
        individuals, the melanosomes are larger, and the transfer may
        occur in the stratum granulosum as well; thus skin pigmentation
        is darker and more persistent.
      \item
        The skin covering most areas of the body has about 1000
        melanocytes per square millimeter. Differences in skin
        pigmentation among individuals do not reflect different numbers
        of melanocytes but instead different levels of melanin
        production.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Carotene}} = an orange-yellow pigment that normally
      accumulates in epidermal cells. It is most apparent in cells of
      the stratum corneum of light-skinned individuals, but it also
      accumulates in fatty tissues in the deep dermis and hypodermis.
      Carotene is found in a variety of orange and yellow vegetables
      (sweet potatoes, carrots, squash).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The blood supply affects skin color because blood contains red blood
    cells filled with the red pigment \textbf{hemoglobin}.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      When bound to oxygen, hemoglobin is bright red, giving capillaries
      in the dermis a reddish tint that is most apparent in
      light-skinned individuals.
    \item
      If those vessels are dilated, the red tones become much more
      pronounced. For example, your skin becomes \textbf{\ul{flushed}}
      and red when your body temperature rises because the superficial
      blood vessels dilate so that the skin can act like a radiator and
      lose heat.
    \item
      When the blood flow decreases, oxygen levels in the tissues
      decline, and under these conditions hemoglobin releases oxygen and
      turns a much darker red. Seen from the surface the skin takes on a
      bluish color. This coloration is called \textbf{\ul{cyanosis}}. In
      individuals of any skin color, cyanosis is most obvious in areas
      of very thin skin (lips and under the fingernails).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

  Accessory Organs of the Skin
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Hair and its associated structures:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Hair follicles}} are a complex structure composed of
    epithelial cells and connective tissues that are responsible for the
    formation of a single hair. The hair follicle has three regions (the
    internal root sheath, the external root sheath, and glassy
    membrane).
  \item
    Hair production begins at the base of the hair follicle. Here a mass
    of epithelial cells forms a cap, called the \textbf{\ul{hair bulb}}
    that surrounds a smaller \textbf{\ul{hair papilla}}, a peg of
    connective tissue containing capillaries and nerves.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Root hair plexus}} are sensory nerves that surround the
    hair bulb and give hair the ability to detect touch.
  \item
    Associated with each hair follicle is a bundle of smooth muscle
    cells called an \textbf{\ul{arrector pili muscle}}. These muscles
    will contract and cause hairs to stand up or become erect.
  \item
    The human body has about 2.5 million hairs and 75\% of them are on
    the general body surface and not on the head. Hairs are non-living
    structures composed of keratinocytes.
  \item
    Parts of a Hair:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Hair shaft}} is the portion of the hair that extends
      through the follicle and protrudes above the skin line.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Hair root}} the portion that anchors the hair into the
      skin
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Cuticle}} forms the surface of the hair. Composed of
      \textbf{hard keratin}.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Cortex}} an intermediate layer of cells deep to the
      cuticle. Contains thick layers of \textbf{hard keratin}, which
      give hairs their stiffness.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Medulla}}, or core, consists of cells at the center of
      the hair matrix filled with \textbf{soft keratin}.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Hair matrix}} consists of superficial cells of the
      hair bulb. These germinative cells in the hair matrix produce the
      hair.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Variations in hair color reflect differences in hair structure and
    variation in the pigment produced by melanocytes at the hair
    papilla. Different forms of melanin give a dark brown, yellow-brown,
    or red color to the hair. As pigment production decreases with age,
    hair color lightens. White hair results from the combination of a
    lack of pigment and the presence of air bubbles in the medulla of
    the hair shaft.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Nails}} = thick sheets of keratinized epidermal cells.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Nails} protect the exposed dorsal surfaces of the tips of
    the fingers and toes. They also help limit distortion of the digits
    whey they are subjected to mechanical stress.
  \item
    The cells producing the nails can be affected by conditions that
    alter body metabolism, so changes in the shape, structure, or
    appearance of the nails can provide useful diagnostic information.
  \item
    Parts of a nail:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Nail body}} = consists of dead, tightly compressed
      keratinocytes packed with keratin. The nail body is the portion of
      the nail to which polish might be applied.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Nail bed}} = the nail body covers an area of the
      epidermis that contains rapidly dividing cells that divide to
      replace the cells that are lost.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Nail root}} = the epidermal fold not visible from the
      surface and anchors the nail body into the underlying tissues; the
      deepest portion of the nail root lies very close to the bone of
      the fingertip.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Hyponychium}} = the free edge of the nail composed of
      a thickened stratum corneum; the distal portion that continues
      past the nail bed.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Eponychium}} = a portion of stratum corneum of the
      nail root that extends over the exposed nail; more commonly called
      the cuticle.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Lunula}} = a pale crescent shaped area near the root
      where the dermal blood vessels are obscured; may not be present in
      all nails

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Sebaceous glands = oil glands

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Simple alveolar glands that are found all over the body except on
    the palms and the soles. Sebaceous follicles secrete onto skin
    surfaces located on the face, back, chest, nipples, and external
    genitalia.
  \item
    Contractions of the arrector pili muscles squeeze the sebaceous
    gland and force the \textbf{\ul{sebum}} (a mixture of triglycerides,
    cholesterol, proteins, and electrolytes) into the hair follicle and
    onto the surface of the skin.
  \item
    These glands are the \textbf{\ul{holocrine type}}, the cells fill up
    with oil then bust.
  \item
    Sebum is secreted into a \textbf{\ul{hair follicle}}, or
    occasionally a pore, or follicle, on the skin surface.
  \item
    Sebum softens and lubricates hair and surrounding skin and also has
    anti-bacterial properties.

  \textbf{\ul{Eccrine (merocrine) sweat glands}} are very numerous in
  the palms, soles of the feet and forehead.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \item
    Eccrine gland secretions, commonly called \textbf{\ul{sweat}}, are a
    hypotonic filtrate of the blood that passes through secretory cells
    of the sweat gland and is release by exocytosis.
  \item
    Once released, the sweat travels via a duct to the surface of the
    skin where it opens into a funnel-shaped pore.
  \item
    Normal pH of sweat is between 4 and 6.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Apocrine sweat glands}}* are largely confined to the

\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Free nerve endings}} = numerous unencapsulated nerve
  endings for pain and temperature detection
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Tactile discs}} = extend from the dermis into the
  epidermis where they connect to Merkel cells and monitor the chemical
  secretions from these cells which produce tactile stimuli.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Tactile corpuscles (Meissner's corpuscles)}} = receptors
  located in the dermal papillae; responsible for the detection of light
  touch
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Lamellated corpuscles (Pacinian corpuscles)}} = receptors
  located in the reticular layer of the dermis; responsible for
  detection of deep pressure and vibration

\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Thermoregulation: your skin can help regulate your body temperature
  via vasodilation and vasoconstriction.
\item
  Vitamin D synthesis: \textbf{\ul{Hormonal Vitamin D}} = also known as
  calcitriol. When exposed to ultraviolet light, epidermal cells in the
  stratum spinosum and stratum basale converts a cholesterol-related
  steroid into \textbf{cholecalciferol}. Although cholecalciferol can be
  obtained from the diet, few foods contain it. In fact most foods that
  contain cholecalciferol have been fortified with it. The liver then
  converts cholecalciferol into an intermediary product used by the
  kidneys to synthesize the hormone \textbf{\ul{calcitriol}}. Calcitriol
  is required for stimulating normal absorption of calcium and
  phosphorus in the small intestine. An inadequate supply of calcitriol
  leads to impaired bone growth and maintenance such as typical of
  \textbf{\ul{rickets}}.

  \textbf{Skin cancers} are the most common types of cancer.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    The most common form of skin cancer is \textbf{\ul{basal cell
    carcinoma}}. This is a cancer that originates in keratinocytes of
    the stratum basale, due to mutations caused by overexposure to the
    UV light. Metastasis virtually never occurs in basal cell
    carcinomas, and most people survive these cancers.
  \item
    In contrast, \textbf{\ul{melanoma}} is the least common form of skin
    cancer but is extremely dangerous. In this condition cancerous
    melanocytes within the stratum basale grow rapidly and metastasize
    through the lymphatic system. The outlook for long-term survival is
    in many cases determined by how early the condition is diagnosed. If
    the cancer is detected early, while it is still localized, the
    affected area can be surgically removed, and the 5-year survival
    rate is 99 percent. If the condition is not detected until extensive
    metastasis has occurred, the 5-year survival rate drops to 14\%.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Squamous cell carcinoma}} originates in the stratum
    spinosum layer and like basal cell carcinoma, it rarely
    metastasizes.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Eczema} is an allergic reaction that manifests as dry, itchy
  patches of skin that look like a rash. It may swell, flake, crack and
  bleed and can be treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
\item
  \textbf{Acne} occurs from an overproductive, blocked sebaceous gland.
\item
  \textbf{Injuries and Burns: First degree burn} effects only the
  epidermis. \textbf{Second degree burn} goes deeper and effects both
  epidermis and dermis. \textbf{Third degree burn} extends through the
  epidermis and dermis to damage underlying tissue and nerve endings.
  \textbf{Fourth degree burn} includes damage to all of the above as
  well as muscle and bone. Full thickness burns can NOT be repaired by
  the body and require a skin graft.
\item
  \textbf{Scars} are collagen-rich skin formed after the process of
  wound healing that differs from normal skin. \textbf{Keloids} are
  raised scars
\item
  \textbf{Bedsores} happen in areas exposed to prolong pressure
  resulting in loss of blood flow and necrosis of the tissues.
\item
  \textbf{Stretch Marks} result from the skin is stretched beyond its
  normal capacity.
\item
  \textbf{Calluses} and \textbf{Corns} form from areas of constant
  abrasion.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Age-related changes alter the appearance of structure of the
    integument.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\Alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Melanocyte activity declines, and in light skinned individuals,
      the skin becomes pale. With less melanin in the skin, people
      become more sensitive to sun exposure and more likely to
      experience sunburn.
    \item
      Sebaceous gland secretions decreases with age and the skin becomes
      dry and often scaly.
    \item
      The epidermis thins as germinative cell activity declines, and the
      connections between the epidermis and dermis weakens, making older
      people more prone to injury, skin tears, and skin infections.
    \item
      The metabolic activity in the skin decreases as well. Synthesis of
      calcitriol (vitamin D\textsubscript{3}) decreases leading to
      muscle weakness and brittle bones.
    \item
      The number of dendritic cells decreases to about half the levels
      seen at maturity. This reduction in cells may decrease sensitivity
      of the immune response and further encourage skin damage and
      infection.
    \item
      The dermis becomes thinner and has fewer elastic fibers, making
      the integument weaker and less resilient. The results -- sagging
      and wrinkling -- are most pronounced in body regions with the most
      sun exposure.
    \item
      Merocrine sweat glands become less active and with impaired
      perspiration processes, older people cannot lose hear at fast as
      younger people. Thus the elder are at greater risk of overheating
      in warm environments.
    \item
      A reduction in dermal blood supply cools the skin, which can
      stimulate thermoreceptors and make a person feel cold even in a
      warm room. Reduced circulation and sweat gland function lessens
      their ability to lose body heat, which can cause their body
      temperature to soar dangerously high.
    \item
      With declining levels of sex hormones, differences in secondary
      sexual characteristics with respect to hair distribution and
      body-fat distribution begin to fade. As a consequence, people age
      90 -- 100 of both sexes tend to look alike.
    \item
      Hair follicles stop functioning or produce thinner, finer hairs.
      With decreased melanocyte activity, these hairs are gray or white.
    \end{enumerate}

  The Functions of the Skeletal System

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Support}} = provides structural support for the entire
    body. Individual bones or groups of bones provide a framework for
    the attachment of soft tissues and or organs.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Protection}} = delicate tissues and organs are often
    surrounded by skeletal elements. The ribs protect the heart and
    lungs, the skull encloses the brain, the vertebrae shield the spinal
    cord, and the pelvis cradles delicate urinary and reproductive
    organs.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Leverage}} = many bones of the skeleton function as
    levers that can change the magnitude and direction of the forces
    generated by skeletal muscles. The movements produced range from the
    delicate motions of a fingertip to powerful changes in the position
    of the entire body.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Storage of minerals}} = the calcium salts of bone
    represents a valuable mineral reserve that maintains normal
    concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions in the body fluids.
    Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body. A typical
    human body contains 1-2 kg of calcium, with more than 98 \% of it
    deposited in the bones of the skeleton.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Blood cell production}} = also known as hematopoiesis;
    red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are produced in
    the red bone marrow, which fills the internal cavities of many
    bones.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

6.2 Bone Classification:

A. The adult skeleton system includes approximately 206 separate bones
and a number of associated cartilages. This body system is divided into
the axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Axial skeleton}} = (80 bones) consists of the bones of the
  skull, hyoid, sternum, rib cage, vertebral column, sacrum, and coccyx.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Appendicular skeleton}} = (126 bones) includes bones of
  the limbs and the pectoral and pelvic girdles that attach the limbs to
  the axial skeleton.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\Alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Bones are classified according to shape and structure and also their
    surface features.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Flat bones}} = thin, roughly parallel surfaces. Flat
      bones form the roof of the skull, sternum, the ribs, and the
      scapulae. They provide protection from underlying soft tissues and
      offer an extensive surface for the attachment of skeletal muscles.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Sutural bones}} = also known as Wormian bones; are
      small, flat, irregularly shaped bones between the flat bones of
      the skull. There are individual variations in the number, shape,
      and position of sutural bones. Their borders are like pieces of a
      jigsaw puzzle, and they range in size from a grain of sand to a
      quarter.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Long bones}} = are relatively long and slender. They
      are located in the arm, forearm, thigh, lower leg, palms, soles,
      fingers and toes. The femur, the long bone of the thigh, is the
      largest and heaviest bone in the body.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Irregular bones}} = have complex shapes with short,
      flat, notched, or ridged surfaces. The spinal vertebrae, the bones
      of the pelvis, and several of the skull bones (mandible for
      example) are irregular bones.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Sesamoid bones}} = are generally small, flat, and
      shaped somewhat like a sesame seed. They develop inside of tendons
      and are most commonly located near joints at the knees, the hands,
      and the feet. Everyone has sesamoid patellae, or kneecaps, but
      individuals vary in the location and abundance of other sesamoid
      bones. This variation, among others, accounts for disparities in
      the total number of bones in the skeleton.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Short bones}} = small and boxy. Examples of short
      bones include bones of the wrist (carpals) and bones of the ankles
      (tarsals).

  Gross Anatomy of long bones: Long bones are designed to transmit
  forces along the shaft and have a rich blood supply.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Diaphysis}} = long tubular shaft that forms the axis of a
  typical long bone; the walls of the shaft are made primarily of
  \textbf{compact bone}.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Epiphyses}} = ends of the bones composed primarily of
  \textbf{spongy bone}, also called \textbf{trabecular bone}. Spongy
  bone consists of an open network of struts and plates (called
  trabeculae) that resemble a latticework with red bone marrow filling
  in the spaces between. The spongy bone is then covered by a thin layer
  of compact bone and articular cartilage.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Proximal epiphyses}}=end closest to the origin of

  attachment.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Metaphysis}} = a narrow zone that connects the diaphysis
  to the epiphyses. The \textbf{epiphyseal plate}, a thin layer of
  hyaline cartilage more commonly called the growth plate, is important
  for growth in the length of bones.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Medullary cavity}} = within the shaft of a long bone is a
  cavity where bone marrow is located. In childhood, the medullary
  cavity is filled with \textbf{red bone marrow} but as we age, fat
  accumulates within the red marrow transforming it to \textbf{yellow
  bone marrow}. Red bone marrow is important for hematopoiesis but
  yellow bone marrow is no longer hematopoietic and instead stores fat
  as an important energy source.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Periosteum}}=outermost covering of bone made primarily of
  dense irregular tissue and held on by Sharpey's fibers (collagen).
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Endosteum}}=internal membrane of bone made of connective
  tissue. Also lines the many canals that pass through bone to supply
  blood and nerves to the bone.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Nutrient foramen}} = in order for bones to grow and be
  maintained, they require an extensive blood supply. The nutrient
  foramen is a tunnel that penetrates the diaphysis and provides access
  for the blood vessels into the shaft of the bone.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Nutrient artery}} = transports oxygenated, nutrient-rich
  blood to the bone.

  blood from the bone.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Metaphyseal artery and metaphyseal vein}} = carry blood to
  and from the area of the metaphysis and to the epiphysis.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Articular cartilage}} = covers portions of the epiphysis
  that articulate with other bones. The cartilage is avascular,
  \textbf{hyaline cartilage}. It relies primarily on diffusion from the
  synovial fluid to obtain oxygen and nutrients and to eliminate wastes.

    Microscopic anatomy of compact bone cells and tissues.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Osteon}} = the basic structural and functional unit of
      bone consisting of bone cells organized around a central canal and
      separated by concentric lamellae.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Central canal}} = also known as the \textbf{Haversian
      canal}, runs parallel to the axis of bone and are located in the
      middle of each osteon. Each central canal possesses an artery and
      vein, lymph vessel, and nerve.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Perforating canals}} = passageways that extend
      perpendicular to the axis of the bone and connect the central
      canals of adjacent osteons.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Lamellae}} = nested, concentric rings of matrix
      surrounding the central canal.

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\arabic{enumiv}.}
      \item
        \textbf{\ul{Circumferential lamellae}} = specialized lamellae
        found at the outer and inner surfaces of bone, where they are
        covered by the periosteum and endosteum, respectively. These
        lamellae are produced during the growth and maintenance of bone.
      \item
        \textbf{\ul{Interstitial lamellae}} = fill in the spaces between
        adjacent osteons of compact bone. These lamellae are remnants of
        osteons whose matrix components have been almost completely
        recycled by the action of bone digesting cells.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Lacunae}} = mature bones cells, called osteocytes, are
      trapped within an open space called a lacuna. Osteocytes cannot
      divide and therefore each lacuna contains only one osteocyte.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Canaliculi}} = processes of the osteocytes extend into
      narrow crevices, called canaliculi, that penetrate the lamellae
      and connect the lacunae to the central canal.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Bone is associated with four cells that account for approximately
    2\% of the bones weight.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Osteocytes}} = mature bone cells that maintain the
      protein and mineral content of the surrounding matrix through the
      turnover of matrix components. Osteocytes secrete chemicals that
      dissolve the adjacent matrix, and the release minerals enter the
      circulation. The osteocytes then rebuild the matrix, stimulating
      the deposition of mineral crystals. Osteocytes also participate in
      the repair of damaged bones.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Osteoblasts}} = immature bone cells located on the
      surface of bone; produce new bone matrix in a process called
      \textbf{osteogenesis}, or \textbf{ossification}. Osteoblasts make
      and release the proteins and other organic components of the
      matrix. Before calcium salts are deposited, this organic matrix is
      called \textbf{\ul{osteoid}}. Osteocytes develop from osteoblasts
      that have become completely surrounded by bone matrix and trapped
      within a lacuna.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Osteoprogenitor cells}} = mesenchymal cells located
      with the periosteum and endosteum. These stem cells divide to
      produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts, and
      they are important in the formation of osteocytes.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Osteoclasts}} = bone digesting cells that remove and
      recycle bone matrix. These are giant cells with 50 or more nuclei.
      Osteoclasts are not related to osteoprogenitor cells or their
      descendants. Instead, they are derived from the same stem cells
      that produce phagocytic white blood cells, called monocytes. Acids
      and proteolytic enzymes secreted by osteoclasts dissolve the
      matrix and release stored minerals. This process, called
      \textbf{\ul{osteolysis}}, or resorption, is important in bone
      remodeling.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Chemical composition of bone:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Organic \textbf{\ul{Osteoid}} = roughly 1/3 of the weight of bone
      is contributed by collagen fibers. Collagen fibers are strong and
      flexible, but if they are compressed, they bend.
    \item
      Inorganic \textbf{\ul{Hydroxyapatites}} = mineral salts account
      for almost 2/3 of the weight of bone. Calcium phosphate interacts
      with calcium hydroxide to form crystals of hydroxyapatite. As they
      form, these crystals incorporate other calcium salts, such as
      calcium carbonate, and ions such as sodium, magnesium, and
      fluoride. By combining the hydroxyapatite with the collagen
      fibers, a strong, somewhat flexible, material is produced.
      Furthermore, this protein-crystal combination is highly resistant
      to shattering. In fact, bone is far superior to concrete and is
      more in par with steel-reinforced concrete.

    Bone Formation and Development
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The formation of bone, osteogenesis or ossification, begins during
  embryonic development. Two types of osteogenesis occur in the embryo:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Endochondral Ossification

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Formation of most bones using a hyaline cartilage model. Begins
    approximately 6 weeks after fertilization.
  \item
    Hyaline cartilage does not turn into bone instead it is broken down
    as ossification occurs.
  \item
    Steps of endochondral ossification:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\roman{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Cavitation of hyaline shaft}}: (picture \#1 and \#2 in
      the diagram)

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv})}
      \item
        Chondrocytes within the shaft hypertrophy (enlarge) and the
        surrounding matrix begins to calcify.
      \item
        The impermeable matrix causes chondrocytes to die from lack of
        nutrients leaving the matrix that starts to deteriorate
        (cavitate).
      \item
        Blood vessels grow around the edges of the cartilage.
      \item
        The cells of the perichondrium convert to osteoblasts producing
        a superficial layer of bone sometimes called the bony collar.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Invasion of internal cavities}}: (picture \#3 in the
      diagram)

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv})}
      \item
        Blood vessels penetrate the cartilage and invade the central
        region. This area within the shaft of hyaline cartilage is
        called the \textbf{primary ossification center}.
      \item
        Migrating with the blood vessels are fibroblasts (which
        differentiate into osteoblasts), lymph vessels, nerve fibers,
        red marrow elements. Collectively, these are called the
        \textbf{periosteal bud}.
      \item
        The osteoblasts secrete osteoid around remaining fragments of
        hyaline, forming trabeculae, or spongy bone.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      Formation of the Medullary cavity: (picture \#4 in the diagram)

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv})}
      \item
        As the primary ossification center enlarges, osteoclasts break
        down newly formed spongy bone and opens up a medullary cavity in
        the center of the diaphysis.
      \item
        The osseous tissue of the outer shaft becomes thicker forming
        compact bone.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Formation of epiphyses}}: (picture \#5 in the diagram)

      \begin{enumerate}
      \def\labelenumiv{\alph{enumiv})}
      \item
        \textbf{Secondary ossification centers} appear in the area at
        the opposite ends of the bone. The cartilage in the epiphyses
        calcifies and deteriorates, forming cavities that allow entry of
        a periosteal bud.
      \item
        Soon the epiphyses are filled with spongy bone. The spongy bone
        is NOT broken down during the remodeling process.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Intramembranous Ossification
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Formation of bones without a cartilage model. Typical in flat bones,
  mandible, clavicles, and patella. Begins approximately 8 weeks after
  fertilization.
\item
  Mesenchyme cells differentiate into osteoblasts within fibrous
  connective tissues. This type of ossification normally occurs in the
  deeper layers of the dermis or in the connective tissues of tendons.
\item
  Steps of intramembranous ossification:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Formation of bone matrix within fibrous membrane:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Mesenchymal cells cluster and secrete organic components of the
  matrix. The location of this activity is the \textbf{ossification
  center}.
\item
  The resulting osteoid mineralizes and the mesenchymal cells
  differentiate into osteoblasts.
\item
  As ossification proceeds, the osteoblasts get trapped within lacunae
  and differentiate into osteocytes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Formation of woven bone and periosteum:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Osteoid accumulates, fuses together forming struts called
  \textbf{trabeculae}, or spicules, around blood vessels.
\item
  The overall structure is similar to spongy bone.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Formation of compact bone plate:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  Initially, the intramembranous bone consists of spongy bone only.
\item
  Subsequent remodeling around trapped blood vessels can produce osteons
  typical of compact bone.
\item
  As the rate of growth slows at the surface, the connective tissue
  around the bone becomes organized into the fibrous layer of the
  periosteum.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  The growth of bone occurs by two primary processes:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Longitudinal Growth (length)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Hyaline cartilage cells form tall columns at the \textbf{epiphyseal
  plate} (or growth plate) and within the articular cartilage.
\item
  The cells at the top of the stack divide quickly, increasing the
  thickness of the epiphyseal plates and causing the entire long bone to
  lengthen.
\item
  Older chondrocytes closer to the shaft enlarge, die, and the
  surrounding cartilage matrix deteriorates.
\item
  The deterioration leaves spicules of calcified cartilage.
\item
  Osteoblasts in the medullary cavity then ossify the cartilage
  spicules, forming spongy bone.
\item
  The hyaline cartilage at the epiphyseal plate is eventually replaced
  entirely by bone. Once completely replaced with bone, the epiphyseal
  plate is now called the \textbf{epiphyseal line}. This typically
  occurs in the person's early twenties and as a result the person stops
  growing in height.

\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Appositional Growth (width)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Osteoprogenitor cells beneath the periosteum differentiate into
  osteoblasts and form new osteons on the external bone surface.
\item
  While bone is being added to the outer surface through appositional
  growth, osteoclasts are removing and recycling lamellae at the inner
  surface. As a result, the medullary cavity gradually enlarges as the
  bone increases in diameter.
\item
  Appositional growth is important in increasing the diameter of
  existing bones but it does not form the original bone.

1. \textbf{Calcium and Vitamin D:} Since the body cannot make calcium,
it must be obtained from the diet. However, calcium cannot be absorbed
from the small intestine without vitamin D. Therefore, intake of vitamin
D is also critical to bone health. Dairy as well as leafy vegetables are
a source of calcium.

2. \textbf{Vitamin K} also supports bone mineralization and may have a
synergistic role with vitamin D in the regulation of bone growth. Green
leafy vegetables are a good source of vitamin K.

C. Hormones:

1. \textbf{Growth Hormone}: synthesized in the pituitary controls bone
growth in multiple ways. It It triggers chondrocyte proliferation in
epiphyseal plates, resulting in the increasing length of long bones. GH
also increases calcium retention, which enhances mineralization, and
stimulates osteoblastic activity, which improves bone density.

2. \textbf{Thyroxine}: secreted by the thyroid gland promotes
osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone matrix.

3. Sex Hormones: \textbf{Estrogen} and \textbf{Testosterone} promote
osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix, and in addition,
are responsible for the growth spurt that often occurs during
adolescence. They also promote the conversion of the epiphyseal plate to
the epiphyseal line (i.e., cartilage to its bony remnant), thus bringing
an end to the longitudinal growth of bones.

4. \textbf{Calcitriol} = the active form of vitamin D, is produced by
the kidneys and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphate from
the digestive tract.

6.7 Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other
Organ Systems

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Bone is constantly undergoing deposition and resorption in a process
  known as \textbf{remodeling}.
\item
  Coordinated activity by osteoblasts and osteoclasts regulates both
  processes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Bone deposition occurs where bone is injured or added bone strength is
  needed and is accomplished by osteoblasts. Bands of new matrix
  deposited in the area are referred to as an osteoid seam.
\item
  Bone reabsorption is accomplished by osteoclasts. Osteoclasts secrete
  lysosomal enzymes that digest the organic matrix and then secrete
  metabolic acids that convert calcium salts into soluble forms.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Remodeling is under negative feedback hormonal control.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Changes in the levels of blood calcium will trigger the release of
  either parathyroid hormone (PTH) or calcitonin.
\item
  When blood calcium levels are too low: the \textbf{parathyroid gland}
  secretes \textbf{\ul{parathyroid hormone}}, or PTH. PTH has three
  effects all leading to a drop in blood calcium levels:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Bone response = stimulates osteoclasts so they accelerate the erosion
  of bone matrix which leads to the release of stored calcium ions into
  the blood.
\item
  Intestinal response = PTH enhances the calcium-absorbing effects of
  calcitriol on the intestine. As a result the rate of intestinal
  calcium absorption increases.
\item
  Kidney response = PTH increases the production of the hormone
  calcitriol, which is continuously secreted by the kidneys at low
  levels. This hormone in turn stimulates calcium reabsorption at the
  kidney tubules.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  When blood calcium levels are too high: the \textbf{C cells of the}
  \textbf{thyroid gland} secrete \textbf{\ul{calcitonin}}. Calcitonin
  has three effects all leading to a drop in blood calcium levels:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Bone response = calcitonin inhibits osteoclasts but does not affect
  osteoblasts so that they continue to deposit calcium ions into the
  matrix of bone.
\item
  Intestinal response = calcitonin decreases the rate of calcium
  absorption from foods in the digestive tract.
\item
  Kidney response = calcitonin inhibits the absorption of calcium in
  urine so that more calcium is excreted from the body.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  By providing a calcium reserve, the skeleton plays the primary role in
  the homeostatic maintenance of normal calcium ion concentration of
  body fluids. The skeleton is also important in the homeostatic balance
  of other ions as well.

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item
    Bone Disorders
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Pituitary growth failure}} = or dwarfism, results from
  inadequate production of growth hormone which leads to reduced
  epiphyseal cartilage activity and abnormally short bones. Rare in the
  United States because children can be treated with synthetic growth
  hormone.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Achondroplasia}} = results from abnormal hyaline cartilage
  development. Because hyaline cartilage forms the model for long bone
  formation, the individual will have short, stocky limbs but the torso
  and head are of normal size.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Marfan syndrome}} = very tall with long, slender limbs due
  to excessive cartilage formation at the epiphyseal plates. Other
  defects in the structure of connective tissues commonly cause
  life-threatening cardiovascular problems.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Gigantism}} = results from an overproduction of growth
  hormone before puberty. Puberty is often delayed. The most common
  cause is a pituitary tumor which may be treated by surgery, radiation,
  or drugs that suppress the release of growth hormone.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Acromegaly}} = result from too much growth hormone after
  the epiphyseal plates close so that the bones do not grow longer but
  instead get thicker (especially the bones of the face, hands, and
  jaw). This leads to changes in their physical appearance.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva}} (FOP) = a rare
  gene mutation that causes the deposition of bone around skeletal
  muscles and the normally soft tissues of the body. There is no
  effective treatment for this painful and debilitating condition, and
  patients seldom survive into their 40's.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Paget's Disease}} = overactive osteoclasts cause pores and
  weakening of the long bones leading to bending/bowing. Osteoblasts try
  to compensate for the overactive osteoclasts, but the bone laid down
  is weak and brittle and prone to fractures.

Divisions of the skeleton:

The skeleton can be divided into two basic parts; the \textbf{axial
skeleton} and the \textbf{appendicular skeleton}. The axial skeleton is
the bones associated with the central portion of the body and include
the bones of the skull, thoracic (chest) cage, and the vertebral column.
The appendicular skeleton is made up of the bones associated with the
limbs and includes the pectoral girdle, the upper limbs, the pelvic
girdle, and the lower limbs.

You are responsible for learning all the bones of the skeleton and all
the markings listed on the next several pages.~

  Types of muscle fibers

  \item
    What two criteria are important for classifying muscle fibers?
  \item
    The three main types of skeletal muscle fibers are:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Slow oxidative fibers which
      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    \item
      Fast oxidative fibers which
      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    \item
      Fast glycolytic fibers which
      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Contraction speed is dependent on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ATPase
    hydrolysis of ATP.
  \item
    Primary metabolic pathway used by a muscle fiber determines if the
    fiber is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Compare and contrast the two types of pathways.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Slow oxidative fibers are able to function for long periods of time
    with fatigue. How does this aid doctors during long surgeries?
  \item
    Fast glycolytic fibers contain high amounts of
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ which allows for the production of ATP via
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. These fibers produce high levels of
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Are these muscle fibers slow or fast to fatigue? Explain.

\item
  Cardiac muscle tissue

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\Alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Contraction of cardiac muscle allows pumping of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
    into the vessels of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ system.
  \item
    Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiac muscle contains many
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for ATP
    production.
  \item
    Cardiac muscle contracts in waves to allow the heart to pump via
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Two important structures important for muscle contraction are
      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and

  \item
    Smooth muscle cells contain \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ instead of the
    troponin-tropomyosin complex.
  \item
    Calcium ions pass through the opened calcium channels in the
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and additional calcium is released from
    the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, binds to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
  \item
    Myosin kinase is then activated by the
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ complex; this will then
    activate the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      The myosin head is then \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ which causes

  Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle Arrangement, and
  Their Lever Systems
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The skeletal muscles of the muscular system account for almost half of
  the weight of our bodies.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The human body contains approximately 700 skeletal muscles that differ
  widely in size, shape, and function.
\item
  Although the individual skeletal muscle fibers contract the same way
  and to the same degree, the performance of a skeletal muscle varies
  depending on the way the muscle fibers are organized and how the
  muscles attach to the skeleton.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  All muscles have at least two points of attachment:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Origin}} = the fixed attachment point
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Insertion}} = the moveable attachment point
  \item
    The origin is typically proximal to the insertion when the body is
    in anatomical position.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When complex movements occur, muscles commonly work in groups rather
  than individually. Their cooperation improves the efficiency of a
  particular movement. For example, large muscles of the limbs produce
  flexion or extension over an extended range of motion.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Agonist}}=a muscle that provides the major force for
    producing a specific movement.~ Also known as the ``prime mover''.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Antagonist}}=muscles that oppose, or reverse, a
    particular movement.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Synergists}}=muscles that help prime movers by: Adding a
    little extra force to the same movement or undesirable or
    unnecessary movements that might occur as the prime movers contract.
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Fixators}}=when synergists immobilize a bone, or a
    muscle's origin.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Fascicle Organization

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Circular}} = also called a sphincter muscle; when the
    fascicles are arranged in concentric rings (example:~ orbicularis
    oris)
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Convergent}}=when the muscle has a broad origin and the
    fascicles converge toward a single tendon or insertion (example:~
    pectoralis major)
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Parallel}}=the long axes of the fascicles run parallel
    to the long axis of the muscle.~ Strap-like muscles (example:~
    sartorius and biceps brachii)
  \item
    \textbf{\ul{Pennate}}=the fascicles are short and they attach
    obliquely to a central tendon that runs the length of the muscle.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Unipennate}}=the fascicles insert into only one side
      of the tendon (example:~ extensor digitorum longus)
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Bipennate}}=fascicles insert into the tendon from
      opposite sides so that the muscle's ``grain'' resembles a feather
      (example:~ rectus femoris)
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Multipennate}}=arrangement looks like many feathers
      situated side by side (example:~ deltoid)
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Muscle Mechanics: Lever Systems

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    The operation of most skeletal muscles involves the use of leverage
    and a lever system.
  \item
    A \textbf{\ul{lever}} is a rigid bar -- such as a board, a crowbar,
    or a bone -- that moves on a fixed point, or \textbf{\ul{fulcrum}},
    when a force is applied to it. The applied force, or
    \textbf{\ul{effort}}, is used to move a resistance, or
    \textbf{\ul{load}}.
  \item
    In the human body, joints are the fulcrums, your bones act as
    levers, and your muscle provide the effort.
  \item
    Levers can operate in one of two ways:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Mechanical advantage}}: the load is close to the
      fulcrum and the effort is applied far from the fulcrum. This
      situation requires minimal effort to move a large load and is
      therefore designed for power. \emph{Power lever}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Mechanical disadvantage}}: the load is far from the
      fulcrum and the effort is applied near the fulcrum. This situation
      requires the force to be greater than the load to be moved but
      although it cannot move a large load, it can move loads farther
      and faster. \emph{Speed lever}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Depending on the relative positions of the three elements (effort,
    fulcrum, and load), a lever belongs to one of three classes:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{First-class lever}} = the fulcrum (F) lies between the
      applied force (AF) and the load (L). An example: scissors or the
      capitis muscles.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Second-class lever}} = the load (L) lies between the
      applied force (AF) and the fulcrum (F). An example: wheelbarrow or
      the gastrocnemius.
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Third-class lever}} = the most common of levers in the
      body, the applied force (AF) is located between the load (L) and
      the fulcrum (F). An example: tweezers and biceps brachii.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{16.1 Overview of the Neurological
Exam}\label{overview-of-the-neurological-exam}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The~\textbf{neurological exam}~is a clinical assessment tool used to
  rapidly determine which specific parts of the CNS are affected by
  damage or disease. The exam can be broken down into the following
  subsets:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Mental Status Exam} = assesses the higher cognitive functions
  such as memory, orientation, and language.
\item
  \textbf{Cranial Nerve Exam} = tests the function of the 12 cranial
  nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral structures
  associated with them.
\item
  \textbf{The Sensory Exam} = tests the sensory functions associated
  with the spinal nerves.
\item
  \textbf{The Motor Exam} = tests the motor functions associated with
  the spinal nerves
\item
  \textbf{The Coordination Exam} = tests the ability to perform complex
  and coordinated movements. \textbf{The Gait Exam} = specifically
  assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of
  the coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\Alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Causes of Neurological Deficits:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{\ul{Stroke}} also called \textbf{CVA} cerebrovascular
      accident= the loss of blood flow to a part of the brain
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Ischemic stroke}} = the loss of blood flow to an area
  because vessels are blocked or narrowed. This is often caused by an
  embolus (blood clot or fat deposit), thickening of the vessel wall or
  drop in blood volume = \textbf{hypovolemia}. \textbf{Transient
  ischemic attack (TIA)} is similar to an ischemic stroke, but symptoms
  are resolved within 24 hours.
\item
  \ul{\textbf{Hemorrhagic} \textbf{stroke}} = bleeding into the brain
  because of a damaged blood vessel. Accumulated blood fills in a region
  of the cranial vault and presses against the tissue in the brain. This
  pooling blood causes secondary symptoms such as loss of function,
  pressure on neighboring arteries resulting in a larger damage area,
  potentially compromising the blood-brain barrier resulting in
  additional fluid on brain = \textbf{edema}.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Blunt force trauma can also cause neurological deficits.
  \item
    Neurodegenerative diseases, developmental, and other disorders
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Alzheimer's disease}} = a progressive disorder
  characterized by the loss of higher cerebral functions and is the most
  common cause of senile dementia or senility. Symptoms may appear at 50
  -- 60 years or age. Associated with ACh shortages, shrinkage of the
  gyri, and formation of neural tangles among the CNS neurons and
  Alzheimer plaques within the cerebrum.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Parkinson's disease}} = neurodegenerative disorder of the
  substantia nigra resulting in decreased production of dopamine. The
  basal nuclei become more active, which raises skeletal muscle tone and
  produces rigidity and stiffness. Individuals, with Parkinson disease
  have difficulty starting voluntary movements, because opposing muscle
  groups do not relax; they must be overpowered. Once a movement is
  underway, every aspect must be voluntarily controlled through intense
  effort and concentration.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Huntington's disease}} = genetic disorder of the basal
  nuclei result in too much movements. occurs 1 in 20,000 births and is
  the result of a dominant gene located on chromosome 4. Causes a
  progressive neurological degeneration leading to death within 20 years
  from onset of symptoms. Symptoms show in 20s or 30-40 years of age.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)}} = progressive,
  degenerative disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal
  cord, brain stem, and cerebral hemispheres. The degeneration affects
  both upper and lower motor neurons. Because a motor neuron and its
  dependent muscle fibers are so intimately related, the destruction of
  the CNS neurons causes atrophy of the associated skeletal muscles.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Rabies}} -- A bite from a rabid animal injects the rabies
  virus into the peripheral tissues, where virus particles quickly enter
  the synaptic knobs. Retrograde flow then carries the virus into the
  CNS, with potential fatal consequences. Many toxins (including heavy
  metals), some pathogenic bacteria, and other viruses also bypass CNS
  defenses by exploiting axoplasmic transport.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Multiple Sclerosis (MS)}} = autoimmune disease causing
  deterioration of the myeline that affects axons in the optic nerve,
  brain, and spinal cord. MS results in paralysis and potentially death.
  The disorder is progressive and functional impairment increases
  following each new incident. Women are 1.5 times more likely to have
  MS than men.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Cerebral Palsy}} -- refers to a number of disorders that
  affect voluntary motor performance; they appear during infancy or
  childhood and persist throughout the life of affected individuals. The
  cause may be trauma associated with premature or unusually stressful
  birth, maternal exposure to drugs, or a genetic defect that causes the
  improper development of motor pathways.
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Referred Pain}} -- the sensation of pain in a part of the
  body other than its actual source.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{16.2 The Mental Status Exam}\label{the-mental-status-exam}

A. Functions of the cerebral cortex

The cerebrum is the seat of many of the higher mental functions, such as
memory and learning, language, and conscious perception, which are the
subjects of subtests of the mental status exam. As discussed in Ch. 13
the cerebrum is a thin layer of gray material about 1 mm thick that is
highly folded. Brodmann first described about 50 different regions of
the cerebrum that correspond to their various functions. There are three
types of processing regions:

1. \textbf{Primary} = The primary cortical areas are where sensory
information is initially processed, or where motor commands emerge to go
to the brain stem or spinal cord.

2. \textbf{Association} = Association areas are adjacent to primary
areas and further process the modality-specific input.

3. \textbf{Integration} areas = Multimodal integration areas are found
where the modality-specific regions meet; they can process multiple
modalities together or different modalities on the basis of similar
functions, such as spatial processing in vision or somatosensation.
Example of picking up a glass and based on what is in it determines what
body movements we make.

B. Cognitive Abilities:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Orientation and Memory
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Orientation} = the patient's awareness of his or her immediate
  circumstances.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item
  \textbf{Awareness of time} = date. ``Do you know what day it is?''
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Awareness of place} = location of where they are and why as
  well as who they are. ``Do you know where you are?,'' ``What is your
  name?,'' ``Who is the current president?''
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Memory} = the patient's ability to recall information. Memory
  is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along with structures
  beneath the cerebral cortex such as the hippocampus and the amygdala.
  Short term memory can be assessed using the three-word test. Patients
  are given three words (ex. Book, clock, train) and after a brief time
  period are asked to recall the three words. Amnesia can be defined as
  losing memories of events of the past \textbf{retrograde amnesia} or
  inability to make future memories \textbf{anterograde amnesia.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Language and Speech

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Language} is at the core of what it means to be self-aware.
    Asking the patient to perform a set of actions can assess the
    ability to understand language. ``Use you right pointer finger to
    touch the tip of your nose and then your left elbow.'' Often,
    language deficits can be determined without specific subtests; if a
    person cannot reply to a question properly, there may be a problem
    with the reception of language. \textbf{Aphasia} is the loss or
    speech or language.
  \item
    Speech
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Broca's area} = responsible for speech production.
  \textbf{Expressive aphasia} = speech production is compromised leading
  to broken or haulted speech with incorrect grammar usage.
\item
  \textbf{Wernicke's area} = responsible for processing or understanding
  speech. \textbf{Receptive aphasia} = patients do not understand what
  is said to them or what they are saying even when they are talking.
\item
  \textbf{Conduction aphasia} = patient's inability to connect
  understanding of speech to production of speech. Symptoms include
  inability to faithfully repeat spoken language.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Sensorium} = the parts of the brain involved in reception and
  interpretation of sensory stimuli. From the primary cortical areas of
  the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and gustatory senses to the
  association areas that process information in these modalities, the
  cerebral cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception. Two
  subtests assess specific functions of these cortical areas.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Praxis} = a practical exercise in which the patient performs a
  task completely on the basis of verbal description without any
  demonstration from the examiner. For example, the patient can be told
  to take their left hand and place it palm down on their left thigh,
  then flip it over so the palm is facing up, and then repeat this four
  times.~
\item
  \textbf{Gnosis} -- sensory perception involving two processes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Stereognosis} = involves the naming of objects strictly on the
  basis of the somatosensory information that comes from manipulating
  them with their eyes closed.
\item
  \textbf{Graphesthesia} = recognize numbers or letters written on the
  palm of the hand with a dull pointer, such as a pen cap.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  \textbf{Judgment and Abstract reasoning} =~Making judgments and
  reasoning in the abstract are necessary to produce movements as part
  of larger responses. ``When your alarm goes off, do you hit the snooze
  button or jump out of bed?'' Is 10 extra minutes in bed worth the
  extra rush to get ready for your day? Will hitting the snooze button
  multiple times lead to feeling more rested or result in a panic as you
  run late? The prefrontal cortex is related to personality
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{16.3 The Cranial Nerve Exam} allows directed tests of forebrain
and brain stem structures

A. Sensory Nerves

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The olfactory nerve (CN I) receives sense of smell
\item
  Optic nerve (CNII) receives sense of vision. Testing vision relies on
  the tests that are common in an optometry office such as
  the~\textbf{Snellen chart.} Testing the extent of the visual field
  means that the examiner can establish the boundaries of peripheral
  vision as simply as holding their hands out to either side and asking
  the patient when the fingers are no longer visible without moving the
  eyes to track them.~Physical inspection of the optic disk, or where
  the optic nerve emerges from the eye, can be accomplished by looking
  through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.
\item
  Vestibulocochlear nerves (CN VIII) receives sense of equilibrium and
  hearing. Problems with balance, such as vertigo, and deficits in
  hearing may both point to problems with the inner ear.~Problems with
  hearing can be assessed using a tuning fork to determine types of
  hearing loss:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Conductive hearing}~= relies on vibrations being conducted
    through the ossicles of the middle ear.
  \item
    \textbf{Sensorineural hearing =} relies on the transmission of sound
    stimuli through the neural components of the inner ear and cranial
    nerve.
  \item
    The \textbf{Rinne test} uses a vibrating tuning fork is placed on
    the mastoid process and the patient indicates when the sound
    produced from this is no longer present. Then the fork is
    immediately moved to just next to the ear canal so the sound travels
    through the air. If the sound is not heard through the ear, meaning
    the sound is conducted better through the temporal bone than through
    the ossicles, a conductive hearing deficit is present.
  \item
    The \textbf{Webber} \textbf{test} also uses a tuning fork to
    differentiate between conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss.
    In this test, the tuning fork is placed at the top of the skull, and
    the sound of the tuning fork reaches both inner ears by travelling
    through bone. In a healthy patient, the sound would appear equally
    loud in both ears. With unilateral conductive hearing loss, however,
    the tuning fork sounds louder in the ear with hearing loss. This is
    because the sound of the tuning fork has to compete with background
    noise coming from the outer ear, but in conductive hearing loss, the
    background noise is blocked in the damaged ear, allowing the tuning
    fork to sound relatively louder in that ear. With unilateral
    sensorineural hearing loss, however, damage to the cochlea or
    associated nervous tissue means that the tuning fork sounds quieter
    in that ear.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  Taste sensation is relayed to the brain stem through fibers of the
  facial (CN VII) and glossopharyngeal nerves (CN IX) and the vagus
  nerve (X).
\item
  The trigeminal nerve (CN V) is a mixed nerve that carries the general
  somatic senses from the head, similar to those coming through spinal
  nerves from the rest of the body. The primary sensory subtest for the
  trigeminal system is sensory discrimination. A cotton-tiped
  applicator, which is cotton attached to the end of a thin wooden
  stick, can be used easily for this. The wood of the applicator can be
  snapped so that a pointed end is opposite the soft cotton-tipped end.
  The cotton end provides a touch stimulus, while the pointed end
  provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus. While the patient's eyes are
  closed, the examiner touches the two ends of the applicator to the
  patient's face, alternating randomly between them. The patient must
  identify whether the stimulus is sharp or dull.
\end{enumerate}

B. Gaze Control

The three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Oculomotor (CN III) - Movement of eyelid and eyeball (via superior
  rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique), shape
  of lens, contracts pupil size
\item
  Trochlear (CN IV) - Movement of eye by the superior oblique
\item
  Abducens (CN VI) - Movement of the eyeball by the lateral rectus
\item
  \textbf{Saccades} = rapid, conjugate movements of the eyes to survey a
  complicated visual stimulus, or to follow a moving visual stimulus.
  Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track
  the tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual field.~
\item
  \textbf{Diplopia}, or double vision,~as the two eyes are temporarily
  pointed at different stimuli.
\item
  \textbf{Convergence} = when the two eyes move to look at something
  closer to the face, they both adduct. To keep the stimulus in focus,
  the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens, which is
  controlled through the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve.
  The change in focal power of the eye is referred to
  as~\textbf{accommodation}. Accommodation ability changes with age;
  focusing on nearer objects, such as the written text of a book or on a
  computer screen, may require corrective lenses later in life.
  Coordination of the skeletal muscles for convergence and coordination
  of the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are
  referred to as the~\textbf{accommodation--convergence reflex}.
\item
  A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli
  centered on the fovea of the retina. The~\textbf{vestibulo-ocular
  reflex (VOR)}coordinates all of the components, both sensory and
  motor, that make this possible
\end{enumerate}

C. Nerves of the Face and Oral Cavity

The facial (CN VII) and glossopharyngeal (CN IX) nerves convey gustatory
stimulation to the brain. The hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that
controls the muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus muscle,
which is controlled by the vagus nerve. There are two sets of muscles of
the tongue. The~\textbf{extrinsic muscles of the tongue}~are connected
to other structures, whereas the~\textbf{intrinsic muscles of the
tongue}~are completely contained within the lingual tissues.~

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Facial nerve = controls muscles controlling facial expressions,
  secretion of saliva by the submandibular and sublingual glands and
  tears by the lacrimal gland, and sensory function for taste from the
  anterior 2/3 of the tongue
\item
  Glossopharyngeal = controls secretion of saliva by the parotid glands,
  elevation of pharynx during swallowing, and taste.
\item
  \textbf{Aguesia} = loss of taste
\item
  \textbf{Bells Palsy} = characterized by muscle weakness that causes
  one half of the face to droop. Bell's palsy may be a reaction to a
  viral infection and usually resolves on its own within six months.
\item
  These nerves can be tested by sticking out the tongue and saying
  ``ah''
\end{enumerate}

D. Motor Nerves of the Neck

The accessory nerve (CN XI) innervates the sternocleidomastoid (flex
head forward and side to side) and trapezius muscles~(extension and
hyperextension of head as well as shrugging of shoulders).

\subsection{16.4 The Sensory and Motor
Exams}\label{the-sensory-and-motor-exams}

A. Sensory Modalities and Location

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Somatic senses are incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or
  tendons, whereas the visceral senses come from nervous tissue
  incorporated into the majority of organs such as the heart or stomach.
\item
  The somatic senses are those that usually make up the conscious
  perception of the how the body interacts with the environment.
\item
  The visceral senses are most often below the limit of conscious
  perception because they are involved in homeostatic regulation through
  the autonomic nervous system.
\item
  Testing of the senses begins with examining the regions known as
  dermatomes that connect to the cortical region where somatosensation
  is perceived in the postcentral gyrus.
\item
  To test the sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch of
  the soft end of a cotton-tipped applicator is applied at various
  locations on the skin.~
\item
  The \textbf{Romberg test} The patient is asked to stand straight with
  feet together then after achieving balance the patient closes their
  eyes and has to maintain the balance.
\end{enumerate}

B. Muscle Strength and Voluntary Movement

1. The skeletomotor system is largely based on the simple, two-cell
projection from the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe to the skeletal
muscles. Outputs from the frontal lobe synapse at the ventral horn motor
neurons (Upper Motor Neuron UMN and Lower Motor Neuron LMN) before
projecting to the skeletal muscle.

2. The lack of muscle tone, known as~\textbf{hypotonicity}
or~\textbf{flaccidity}, may indicate that the LMN is not conducting
action potentials that will keep a basal level of acetylcholine in the
neuromuscular junction.

3. If muscle tone is present, muscle strength is tested by having the
patient contract muscles against resistance. The examiner will ask the
patient to lift the arm, for example, while the examiner is pushing down
on it.

4. Diseases that result in UMN lesions include cerebral palsy or MS, or
it may be the result of a stroke. A sign of UMN lesion is a negative
result in the subtest for~\textbf{pronator drift}.

5. The patient is asked to extend both arms in front of the body with
the palms facing up. While keeping the eyes closed, if the patient
unconsciously allows one or the other arm to slowly relax, toward the
pronated position, this could indicate a failure of the motor system to
maintain the supinated position.

C. Reflexes

See Ch. 15 reflex discussion on stretch reflex and superficial reflexes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  For the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps,
  brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the leg, the
  knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex
  for the gastrocnemius and soleus.~
\end{enumerate}

2. \textbf{Plantar reflex}~that tests for the~\textbf{Babinski sign}~on
the basis of the extension or flexion of the toes at the plantar surface
of the foot. The plantar reflex is commonly tested in newborn infants to
establish the presence of neuromuscular function. To elicit this reflex,
an examiner brushes a stimulus, usually the examiner's fingertip, along
the plantar surface of the infant's foot. An infant would present a
positive Babinski sign, meaning the foot dorsiflexes and the toes extend
and splay out. As a person learns to walk, the plantar reflex changes to
cause curling of the toes and a moderate plantar flexion.~

D. Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage

1. Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that
will address whether damage to the motor system is in the upper or lower
motor neurons. Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness,
strong deep tendon reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness,
pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign,~\textbf{spasticity}, and
the~\textbf{clasp-knife response}. Spasticity is an excess contraction
in resistance to stretch. It can result in~\textbf{hyperflexia}, which
is when joints are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when
the patient initially resists movement, but then releases, and the joint
will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.

2. A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial
loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as~\textbf{paresis}.
The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred to as~\textbf{flaccid
paralysis}, referring to a complete or partial loss of muscle tone, in
contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained
and spasticity is exhibited. Other signs of an LMN lesion
are\textbf{fibrillation},~\textbf{fasciculation}, and compromised or
lost reflexes resulting from the denervation of the muscle fibers

\textbf{16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams}

\subsubsection{A. Locations and Connections of the
Cerebellum}\label{a.-locations-and-connections-of-the-cerebellum}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\ul{Cerebellum}} = accounts for 11\% of the brain's mass.
\item
  The cerebellum functions in the coordination and modulation of motor
  command from the cerebral cortex and maintaining balance and
  equilibrium.
\item
  The cerebellum is partially hidden by the cerebral hemispheres and is
  the second largest structure in the brain.
\item
  The cerebellum is separated from the cerebrum by the
  \textbf{\ul{transverse fissure}}.
\item
  The cerebellum also possesses fold-like wrinkles called
  \textbf{\ul{folia}}, is divided into two hemispheres, and further
  subdivided into lobes: the \textbf{anterior lobe and posterior lobe}.
\item
  The two cerebellar hemispheres are separated by the \textbf{vermis}
  while the anterior and posterior lobes are separated by
  \textbf{\ul{the primary fissure}}.
\item
  The white matter of the cerebellum is called the \textbf{\ul{arbor
  vitae}} and is surrounded by gray matter called the
  \textbf{\ul{cerebellar cortex}}.
\end{enumerate}

B. Coordination and Alternating Movement

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam.
  The subtests target appendicular musculature, controlling the limbs,
  and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of
  cerebellar function will depend on the normal functioning of other
  systems addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor
  control from the cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic,
  visual, and vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar function.
\item
  The subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the
  lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a check for tremor. The
  patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position
  while the examiner watches for tremors.
\item
  The~\textbf{check reflex}~depends on cerebellar input to keep
  increased contraction from continuing after the removal of resistance.
  The patient flexes the elbow against resistance from the examiner to
  extend the elbow.~
\end{enumerate}

C. Posture and Gait

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Gait can either be considered a separate part of the neurological exam
  or a subtest of the coordination exam that addresses walking and
  balance.~
\item
  A subtest called station begins with the patient standing in a normal
  position to check for the placement of the feet and balance. The
  patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain
  balance and posture during movement.~
\item
  Subtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally for a
  distance away from the examiner, and then turn and return to the
  starting position. The examiner watches for abnormal placement of the
  feet and the movement of the arms relative to the movement. The
  patient is then asked to walk with a few different variations. Tandem
  gait is when the patient places the heel of one foot against the toe
  of the other foot and walks in a straight line in that manner. Walking
  only on the heels or only on the toes will test additional aspects of
  balance.
\end{enumerate}

D. \textbf{Ataxia} = presents as a loss of coordination in voluntary
movements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that cause balance
problems, primarily in proprioception and equilibrium. Ataxia is often
the result of exposure to exogenous substances (alcohol, ketamine or
mercury), focal lesions (stroke, trauma, MS, or tumor), or a genetic

\item
  \textbf{An Introduction to the Endocrine System and Hormones.} The
  endocrine system works with or in harmony with the nervous system to
  control and coordinate all the activities of the body and to maintain
  homeostasis. \textbf{Endocrinology} - field of medicine that focuses
  on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    The endocrine system and nervous system are similar yet different:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Both systems rely on the release of chemicals that bind to
      specific receptors on their target cells.
    \item
      Both share many chemical messengers; when released into the
      bloodstream they are called hormones but when released into a
      synapse, they are called neurotransmitters.
    \item
      Both systems are regulated primarily by negative feedback control.
    \item
      Both share a common goal: to preserve homeostasis by coordinating
      and regulating the activities of other cells, tissues, organs, and
      systems.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Mechanisms of Intercellular Communication

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{Direct communication} -- via \textbf{gap junctions}; use
      ions, small solutes, and other lipid-soluble materials as chemical
      mediators; effects are usually limited to adjacent cells of the
      same type that are interconnected by connexons.
    \item
      \textbf{Paracrine communication} -- via \textbf{extracellular
      fluids}; use paracrine factors as chemical mediators; effects are
      primarily limited to the local area where paracrine factor
      concentrations are relatively high; target cells must have
      appropriate receptors.
    \item
      \textbf{Endocrine communication} -- via the \textbf{bloodstream};
      use hormones as chemical mediators; effects are on target cells
      located in other tissues or organs; target cells must have an
      appropriate receptor.
    \item
      \textbf{Neural communication} -- via \textbf{synaptic clefts}; use
      neurotransmitters as chemical mediators; effects are limited to
      very specific areas; target cells must have appropriate receptors.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Structures of the endocrine system:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \item
      Thalamus
    \item
      Pineal gland
    \item
      Pituitary gland
    \item
      Thyroid
    \item
      Thymus
    \item
      Adrenal
    \item
      Pancreas

      Testes
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{17.2 Hormones} are chemical messengers released by endocrine
cells/glands into bloodstream to be transported throughout the body to
regulate the metabolic functions and activities of other cells of the
body. See table at end of outline for list of endocrine glands and their
related hormones.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Hormones and paracrine factors of the body can be divided into groups:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Amino acid derivatives} -- hormones derived from a single
  amino acid. Examples include: the thyroid hormones such as thyroxine
  and triiodothyronine; the \textbf{catecholamines} such as epinephrine,
  norepinephrine, and dopamine; and melatonin
\item
  \textbf{Peptide hormones} -- chains of amino acids. Examples include:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Polypeptides}: antidiuretic hormone (9 amino acids) and
    oxytocin (9 amino acids)
  \item
    \textbf{Small proteins}: insulin (51 amino acids), growth hormone
    (191 amino acids) and prolactin (198 amino acids)
  \item
    \textbf{Glycoproteins}: thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing
    hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Lipid derivative}s -- consist of carbon rings and side chains
  built either from fatty acids chains or cholesterol.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Eicosanoids} -- built from fatty acid chains and include:
    leukotrienes and prostaglandins.
  \item
    \textbf{Steroid hormones} -- built from cholesterol molecules and
    include: testosterone, estrogen and progesterone, corticosteroids,
    and calcitriol.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Pathways of Hormone Action

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Lipid-soluble} = A steroid hormone directly initiates the
    production of proteins within a target cell. Steroid and thyroid
    hormones easily diffuse through the cell membrane. The steroid
    hormone binds to its receptor in the cytosol, forming a
    receptor--hormone complex. The receptor--hormone complex then enters
    the nucleus and binds to the target gene on the DNA. Thyroid
    hormones bind to receptors already bound to DNA. Transcription of
    the gene creates a messenger RNA that is translated into the desired
    protein within the cytoplasm.
  \item
    \textbf{Water-soluble} = Water-soluble hormones cannot diffuse
    through the cell membrane. These hormones must bind to a surface
    cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cell-
    signaling pathway within the cell involving G proteins, adenylyl
    cyclase, the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), and protein
    kinases. In the final step, these protein kinases phosphorylate
    proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates proteins in the cell that
    carry out the changes specified by the hormone.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Hormones are regulated by feedback mechanisms and hormonal
  interactions

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Factors Affecting Target Cell Response. Hormones must have receptors
    on their target tissue.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{Downregulation} - the presence of a significant level of a
      hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells
      to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone, allowing
      cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels.
    \item
      \textbf{Upregulation} - cells increase their number of receptors
      due to the level of a hormone becoming chronically reduced.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Interactions between hormones:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{Antagonistic effects} - one hormone inhibits the response
      of another therefore they generate opposite responses; example:
      insulin lowers blood sugar while glucagon raises blood sugar
    \item
      \textbf{Synergistic effects} - two hormones with similar effects
      produce an amplified response. In some cases, two hormones are
      required for an adequate response. For example, two different
      reproductive hormones---FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens
      from the ovaries---are required for the maturation of female ova
      (egg cells).
    \item
      \textbf{Permissive effects} - one hormone is needed to activate
      another; example: rennin stimulates the conversion of Angiotensin
      I into Angiotensin II
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Feedback mechanisms

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \item
      \textbf{Negative feedback systems} - physiological response causes
      a decrease in the release of the hormone; most commonly used
    \item
      \textbf{Positive feedback systems} - physiological response causes
      an increase in the release of the hormone; rarely used
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Role of endocrine gland stimuli: Hormones can stimulate behavior or
  behavior may stimulate hormones. Elevated hormone levels do not equate
  to elevated behavior.
\end{enumerate}

17.3 Hypothalamus and Pituitary

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Hypothalmus
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The hypothalamus provides the highest level of endocrine control. It
  integrates the activities of the nervous system and endocrine system.
\item
  The hypothalamus accomplishes this integration through three
  mechanisms:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that exert direct neural
  control of the endocrine cells, called chromaffin cells, of the
  adrenal medulla. When the sympathetic division is activated, this
  direct control allows the immediate stimulation of the adrenal gland.
\item
  Hypothalamic neurons synthesize two hormones -- ADH and OXT -- and
  transport them along axons within the infundibulum to the posterior
  lobe of the pituitary for storage and secretion.
\item
  The hypothalamus secretes regulatory hormones that control the
  secretions of the anterior pituitary gland. These regulatory hormones,
  called \textbf{releasing hormones} (RH) and \textbf{inhibiting
  hormones} (IH), flow via a network of fenestrated capillaries called
  the \textbf{hypophyseal portal system}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Pituitary Gland -- Hypophysis
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Also known as the ``master gland'' is located within the \textbf{sella
  turcica} of the sphenoid bone.
\item
  Connected to the hypothalamus via the infundibulum and a network of
  capillaries called the hypophyseal portal system. Divided into two
  lobes: an anterior lobe and a posterior lobe.
\item
  \textbf{Neurohypophysis} -- the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland
  connected to the hypothalamus by the \textbf{infundibulum}; contains
  the axons of the hypothalamic neurons. Stores and secretes hormones
  synthesized in the hypothalamus:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Antidiuretic hormone} (ADH also known as vasopressin) --
  increases water reabsorption within the renal tubules of the kidney.
  This results in a decrease in water loss from urine.
\item
  \textbf{Oxytocin} (OXT) -- stimulates the smooth muscle contractions
  of the uterus which initiates child birth. After delivery, stimulates
  the ejection of milk. In both sexes, known as the ``cuddle hormone''
  as it surges during arousal and orgasm.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  \textbf{Adenohypophysis} -- the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland
  connected to the hypothalamus by the \textbf{hypophyseal portal
  system}. Controlled by regulating hormones, called \textbf{releasing
  hormones} (RH) and \textbf{inhibiting hormones} (IH) from the
  hypothalamus:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Thyroid stimulating hormone} (TSH) -- targets the thyroid
  gland; stimulates the thyroid to grow and increase its secretion of
  the thyroid hormones, T\textsubscript{3} and T\textsubscript{4}.
  Released in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from
  hypothalamus.
\item
  \textbf{Adrenocorticotropic hormone} (ACTH or corticotropin) --
  stimulates the release of steroid hormones by the adrenal cortex.
  Released in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the
  hypothalamus.
\item
  \textbf{Follicle stimulating hormone} (FSH or gonadotropin) --
  promotes ovarian follicles to develop in females and, in conjunction
  with luteinizing hormone, stimulates the secretion of estrogens. In
  males FSH promotes the physical maturation in sperm. Released in
  response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the
  hypothalamus.
\item
  \textbf{Luteinizing hormone} (LH) -- induces ovulation in females and
  promotes the secretion of estrogen and progesterone. In males it
  stimulates the production of sex hormones called androgens,
  specifically testosterone. Released in response to
  gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus.
\item
  \textbf{Growth hormone} (GH) -- stimulates cell growth and
  reproduction by accelerating the rate of protein synthesis
  particularly in skeletal muscle and bone. Regulated by growth
  hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH) and growth hormone-inhibiting
  hormone (GH-IH) from the hypothalamus.
\item
  \textbf{Prolactin} (PRL or luteotropic hormone) -- works with other
  hormones to stimulate mammary gland development and the production of
  milk during pregnancy and during nursing. Regulated by several
  prolactin-releasing hormones and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH).
\item
  \textbf{Melanocyte stimulating hormone} (MSH) -- stimulates
  melanocytes of the skin to increase their production of melanin.
  Non-functional in adults.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{3}
  \item
    Thyroid Gland
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Located in the neck just below the larynx and anterior to the trachea.
  Divided into a right and left lobe connected by a narrow
  \textbf{isthmus}. Regulated by TSH from the pituitary gland.
\item
  The thyroid gland contains large numbers of \textbf{thyroid follicles}
  -- hollow spheres lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium called the
  \textbf{follicle cells}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The follicle cells surround a cavity that holds a viscous
  \textbf{colloid}, a fluid containing a large quantity of dissolved
  proteins.
\item
  The follicle cells synthesize a globular protein called
  \textbf{thyroglobulin} and secrete it into the colloid of the thyroid
  follicle.
\item
  The thyroglobulin molecules contain the amino acid tyrosine. The
  thyroglobulin is combined with \textbf{iodide ions} absorbed from the
  diet to form the thyroid hormones: \textbf{T\textsubscript{3}
  (triiodothyronine)} and \textbf{T\textsubscript{4} (thyroxine)}.
\item
  Thyroid hormones have several effects in the body:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Stimulates red blood cell production and thus enhanced oxygen
  delivery.
\item
  Stimulates the activity of other endocrine tissues.
\item
  Accelerates the turnover of minerals in bone.
\item
  Elevates rates of oxygen consumption and energy consumption in cells;
  increase basal metabolic rates.
\item
  Increases heart rate and force of contraction resulting in increased
  blood pressure.
\item
  Increases sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation.
\item
  Maintains the normal sensitivity of respiratory centers to changes in
  oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Between the follicles is a second population of endocrine cells called
  \textbf{parafollicular cells}, or \textbf{C (clear) cells}. Clear
  cells produce \textbf{calcitonin} (CT) which lowers blood calcium
  levels when they are too high. Calcitonin works by increasing the
  amount of calcium excreted in urine and increasing the deposition of
  calcium in bone by stimulating \textbf{osteoblast} activity.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{Oxyphil cells} -- have no known function.
\item
  \textbf{Chief cells} -- produce \textbf{parathyroid hormone} (PTH)
  which increases blood calcium levels when they are too low.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  PTH and calcitonin work as antagonists to maintain homeostasis of
  blood calcium levels. PTH specifically targets:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Bones -- activates \textbf{osteoclasts} causing calcium and phosphate
  ions to be released into the blood.
\item
  Intestine~-- increases calcium absorption from food.
\item
  Kidneys~-- promotes activation of vitamin D and increases calcium
  reabsorption in the kidney tubules.

\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Adrenal medulla} releases hormones when the body is under
  stress and consists of hormone-producing cells called
  \textbf{chromaffin} \textbf{cells}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Epinephrine (aka adrenaline)} -- (80\%) elevates blood sugar,
  regulates body during stress or anger; raises blood pressure, heart
  beat, glycogen breakdown and increases all other sympathetic effects
  of the nervous system.
\item
  \textbf{Norepinephrine} \textbf{(aka noradrenaline}) -- helps maintain
  blood pressure, and accounts for 20\% of the hormones released by the
  medullary portion of the adrenal gland.

    These hormones increase the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to
    prepare the body to fight the perceived threat or flee from it.
  \item
    Dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels.
  \item

  Insulin and glucagon work as antagonists to maintain homeostasis of
  blood sugar.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  glucose into body cells, converting excess glucose to glycogen for
  short-term storage (glycogenesis) and into fat for long-term storage
  in adipocytes (lipogenesis).
\item
  Glucagon raises blood glucose levels by breaking down glycogen into
  glucose (glycogenolysis), synthesizes glucose from lactic acid and
  other non-carbohydrate molecules (gluconeogenesis), and releases
  glucose to the blood by liver cells.

    from vitamin D3 and to increase phosphorus excretion during high
    blood calcium levels.
  \item
    \textbf{Osteocalcin}, produced by osteoblasts, stimulates the
    pancreatic beta cells to increase insulin production. It also acts
    on peripheral tissues to increase their sensitivity to insulin and
    their utilization of glucose.

  Aging
\end{enumerate}

As the body ages, changes occur that affect the endocrine system,
sometimes altering the production, secretion, and catabolism of
hormones. For example, the structure of the anterior pituitary gland
changes as vascularization decreases and the connective tissue content
increases with increasing age. This restructuring affects the gland's
hormone production. Certain hormones and gland production decrease with
age: reduced cortisol and aldosterone from adrenal gland, lower estrogen
and progesterone from ovaries, as well as lower testosterone levels.
